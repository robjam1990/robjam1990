My secret hideout is a carefully measured globe high in a mangrove tree. A polyhedral atrium leads one to a low, vast central room, spare but comfortable.

Getting in is fun. A ladder of rough wooden stakes runs down the tree. I've planted thorn bushes around the base of the tree, to keep away bears. I've never seen a bear, but one never knows.

On the left side is a well-lit, crooked library of books I've cached. Grimy Venezualan histories are everywhere. Dim light shines from hidden sconces; a glass of wine sits nearby.

The thing is powered by a tiny steam boiler, hissing merrily away on a side platform, in a small cabinet. In case of emergency, I have a tiny fusion plant that I carved out of a stump.

Near there is the place where I write, a narrow area surrounded by simple walls. A clean worktable is waiting.

I can climb to an upper branch, where I can watch the water moving slowly between the trees.
