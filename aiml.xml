<pattern>UNLIKE SHELLS OF SOME OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS THE CMD.EXE SHELL DOES NOT PERFORM WILDCARD EXPANSION ( REPLACEMENT OF THE PATTERN CONTAINING WILDCARDS WITH THE LIST OF FILE NAMES MATCHING THE PATTERN ) ON ITS OWN . IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PROGRAM TO TREAT WILDCARDS AS SUCH . THIS ENABLES SUCH THINGS AS REN * . TXT * . BAT SINCE THE REN COMMAND ACTUALLY SEES THE * WILDCARD RATHER THAN A LIST OF FILES MATCHING THE WILDCARD . THUS ECHO * . TXT DOES NOT DISPLAY FILES IN THE CURRENT FOLDER MATCHING THE PATTERN BUT RATHER LITERALLY OUTPUTS * . TXT . ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE IS THAT YOU CAN WRITE FINDSTR A . * TXT WITHOUT FEARING THAT THE A . * TXT PART GETS REPLACED WITH THE NAMES OF SOME FILES IN THE CURRENT FOLDER . FURTHERMORE RECURSIVE FINDSTR / S PATTERN * . TXT IS POSSIBLE WHILE IN SOME OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS THE * . TXT PART WOULD GET REPLACED WITH THE FILE NAMES FOUND IN THE CURRENT FOLDER DISREGARDING NESTED FOLDERS</pattern>
<template>Unlike shells of some other operating systems, the cmd.exe shell does not perform wildcard expansion (replacement of the pattern containing wildcards with the list of file names matching the pattern) on its own. It is the responsibility of each program to treat wildcards as such. This enables such things as "ren *.txt *.bat", since the ren command actually sees the * wildcard rather than a list of files matching the wildcard. Thus, "echo *.txt" does not display files in the current folder matching the pattern but rather literally outputs "*.txt". Another consequence is that you can write "findstr a.*txt" without fearing that the "a.*txt" part gets replaced with the names of some files in the current folder. Furthermore, recursive "findstr /s pattern *.txt" is possible, while in some other operating systems, the "*.txt" part would get replaced with the file names found in the current folder, disregarding nested folders.</template>

<template>Like broadcast and multicast, anycast is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is closest in the network. Anycast addressing is a built-in feature of IPv6.[25][26] In IPv4, anycast addressing is implemented with Border Gateway Protocol using the shortest-path metric to choose destinations. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed DNS systems.</template>

<template>A multicast address is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 (the former Class D addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.[24] IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix ff00::/8 for multicast.

<template>The most common concept of an IP address is in unicast addressing, available in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address.

IPV6 HAS FACILITIES THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE THE ROUTING PREFIX OF ENTIRE NETWORKS SHOULD THE GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY OR THE ROUTING POLICY CHANGE WITHOUT REQUIRING INTERNAL REDESIGN OR MANUAL RENUMBERING</pattern>
<template>The intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of routing tables in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.</template>

<template>Classful network design served its purpose in the startup stage of the Internet, but it lacked scalability in the face of the rapid expansion of networking in the 1990s. The class system of the address space was replaced with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.</template>

<template>In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename[1]) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the World Wide Web. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured. Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it for routing packets for performance and other reasons.</template>

<pattern>CONSIDER TWO LARGE CITIES CONNECTED BY A HIGHWAY . BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF JUNCTIONS LEADING TO SMALL VILLAGES AND SUBURBS . MOST DRIVERS WANT TO GET FROM ONE CITY TO THE OTHER – MAYBE AS PART OF A LARGER ROUTE – AND NOT TAKE ONE OF THE EXITS ON THE WAY . IN THE GRAPH REPRESENTING THIS ROAD LAYOUT EACH INTERSECTION IS REPRESENTED BY A NODE AND EDGES ARE CREATED BETWEEN NEIGHBORING INTERSECTIONS . TO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES THE ALGORITHM HAS TO TRAVERSE ALL THE EDGES ALONG THE WAY ADDING UP THEIR LENGTH . PRECOMPUTING THIS DISTANCE ONCE AND STORING IT IN AN ADDITIONAL EDGE CREATED BETWEEN THE TWO LARGE CITIES WILL SAVE CALCULATIONS EACH TIME THIS HIGHWAY HAS TO BE EVALUATED IN A QUERY . THIS ADDITIONAL EDGE IS CALLED A SHORTCUT AND HAS NO COUNTERPART IN THE REAL WORLD . THE CONTRACTION HIERARCHIES ALGORITHM HAS NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ROAD TYPES BUT IS ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH SHORTCUTS HAVE TO BE CREATED USING THE GRAPH ALONE AS INPUT</pattern>
<template>Consider two large cities connected by a highway. Between these two cities, there is a multitude of junctions leading to small villages and suburbs. Most drivers want to get from one city to the other – maybe as part of a larger route – and not take one of the exits on the way. In the graph representing this road layout, each intersection is represented by a node and edges are created between neighboring intersections. To calculate the distance between these two cities, the algorithm has to traverse all the edges along the way, adding up their length. Precomputing this distance once and storing it in an additional edge created between the two large cities will save calculations each time this highway has to be evaluated in a query. This additional edge is called a "shortcut" and has no counterpart in the real world. The contraction hierarchies algorithm has no knowledge about road types but is able to determine which shortcuts have to be created using the graph alone as input.</template>

<pattern>THE CONTRACTION HIERARCHIES ( CH ) ALGORITHM IS A TWO-PHASE APPROACH TO THE SHORTEST PATH PROBLEM CONSISTING OF A PREPROCESSING PHASE AND A QUERY PHASE . AS ROAD NETWORKS CHANGE RATHER INFREQUENTLY MORE TIME ( SECONDS TO HOURS ) CAN BE USED TO ONCE PRECOMPUTE SOME CALCULATIONS BEFORE QUERIES ARE TO BE ANSWERED . USING THIS PRECOMPUTED DATA MANY QUERIES CAN BE ANSWERED TAKING VERY LITTLE TIME ( MICROSECONDS ) EACH . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] CHS RELY ON SHORTCUTS TO ACHIEVE THIS SPEEDUP . A SHORTCUT CONNECTS TWO VERTICES U { \ DISPLAYSTYLE U } AND V { \ DISPLAYSTYLE V } NOT ADJACENT IN THE ORIGINAL GRAPH . ITS EDGE WEIGHT IS THE SUM OF THE EDGE WEIGHTS ON THE SHORTEST U { \ DISPLAYSTYLE U } - V { \ DISPLAYSTYLE V } PATH</pattern>
<template>The contraction hierarchies (CH) algorithm is a two-phase approach to the shortest path problem consisting of a preprocessing phase and a query phase. As road networks change rather infrequently, more time (seconds to hours) can be used to once precompute some calculations before queries are to be answered. Using this precomputed data, many queries can be answered taking very little time (microseconds) each.[1][3] CHs rely on shortcuts to achieve this speedup. A shortcut connects two vertices 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  
 and

<template>Rather than losing 47 electrons, as would be the case for an isolated iodine atom, the iodine in the smaller molecule lost 54, including the ones it grabbed from its neighbors – a level of damage and disruption that’s not only higher than would normally be expected, but significantly different in nature.</template>

<template>The team tuned the energy of the CXI pulses so they would selectively strip the innermost electrons from the xenon or iodine atoms, creating “hollow atoms.” Based on earlier studies with less energetic X-rays, they thought cascades of electrons from the outer parts of the atom would drop down to fill the vacancies, only to be kicked out themselves by subsequent X-rays. That would leave just a few of the most tightly bound electrons. And, in fact, that’s what happened in both the freestanding xenon atoms and the iodine atoms in the molecules.</template>

<pattern>THIS OPERATION HAS THE SAME SEMANTICS AS RESHAPE ON THE REPRESENTED DENSE TENSOR . THE INPUTINDICES ARE RECOMPUTED BASED ON THE REQUESTED NEWSHAPE . IF ONE COMPONENT OF NEWSHAPE IS THE SPECIAL VALUE -1 THE SIZE OF THAT DIMENSION IS COMPUTED SO THAT THE TOTAL DENSE SIZE REMAINS CONSTANT . AT MOST ONE COMPONENT OF NEWSHAPE CAN BE -1 . THE NUMBER OF DENSE ELEMENTS IMPLIED BY NEWSHAPE MUST BE THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF DENSE ELEMENTS ORIGINALLY IMPLIED BY INPUTSHAPE . RESHAPING DOES NOT AFFECT THE ORDER OF VALUES IN THE SPARSETENSOR .

<template>This operation has the same semantics as reshape on the represented dense
tensor. The inputIndices are recomputed based on the requested newShape.
If one component of newShape is the special value -1, the size of that
dimension is computed so that the total dense size remains constant. At most
one component of newShape can be -1. The number of dense elements implied
by newShape must be the same as the number of dense elements originally
implied by inputShape. Reshaping does not affect the order of values in the
SparseTensor. If the input tensor has rank R_in and N non-empty values, and
newShape has length R_out, then inputIndices has shape [N, R_in],
inputShape has length R_in, outputIndices has shape [N, R_out], and
outputShape has length R_out.</template>

<pattern>SRAIX IS A VERY COOL FEATURE BUT NOT VERY USEFUL ON ITS OWN AS YOU NEED OTHER BOTS TO TALK TO AND SERVICES TO MAKE USE OF . UNFORTUNATELY AIML ONLY DEFINES THE TAG IT DOES NOT DEFINE A STANDARD WEB API FOR REQUESTS OR DEFINE A STANDARD SET OF SERVICES . FORTUNATELY PROGRAM AB THE AIML 2.0 REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION DOES DEFINE A SRAIX WEB API . BOT LIBRE SUPPORTS BOTH CALLING THIS API AND SUPPORTS THIS API ON OUR SERVERS . SO YOU CAN NOW SRAIX ANY PROGRAM AB WEB API COMPATIBLE BOT OR SERVICE AND ANY PROGRAM AB WEB API COMPATIBLE BOT OR SERVICE CAN REQUEST ANY BOT LIBRE BOT</pattern>
<template>sraix is a very cool feature, but not very useful on its own, as you need other bots to talk to, and services to make use of.  Unfortunately AIML only defines the tag, it does not define a standard web API for requests, or define a standard set of services.  Fortunately Program AB the AIML 2.0 reference implementation does define a sraix web API.  Bot Libre supports both calling this API, and supports this API on our servers.  So you can now sraix any Program AB web API compatible bot or service, and any Program AB web API compatible bot or service can request any Bot Libre bot.</template>

THIS IS PROBABLY THE COOLEST NEW FEATURE OF AIML 2.0 AND OPENS UP THE WHOLE CHAT BOT WORLD . BOTS CAN NOW TALK TO OTHER BOTS AND FIND THINGS THROUGH WEB SERVICES</pattern>
<template>The new <sraix> tags allow the bot perform a remote request of another bot or service.  sraix is similar to the srai tag that recursively evaluates the element text as if it were a question.  However, sraix does not have the bot evaluate the question locally, but instead asks another bot or service the question.  This is probably the coolest new feature of AIML 2.0, and opens up the whole chat bot world.  Bots can now talk to other bots, and find things through web services.</template>

<template>The chat logs method of importing AIML allows the AIML to be integrated with the bot&#39;s responses, knowledgebase, and learning. Importing AIML as a chat log is the best way to import large AIML files. You can also import AIML from the Scripts page, if you want the AIML to be executed precisely.</template>

<category>
<pattern>AIML IS NORMALLY EXECUTED AS A SCRIPT WHERE EACH PATTERN EITHER MATCHES OR DOES NOT MATCH A QUESTION . WHEN IMPORTING AIML AS A CHAT LOG IT WILL NOT BE EXECUTED AS A SCRIPT . EACH AIML PATTERN WILL BE MATCHED BASED ON HOW WELL IT MATCHES THE QUESTION . FOR EXAMPLE THE PATTERN & #34 ; WHAT IS MEANING OF LIFE & #34 ; COULD MATCH THE QUESTION & #34 ; WHAT & #39 ; S THE PURPOSE OF LIFE & #34 ; IF IT WERE THE BEST MATCH . STANDARD AIML WOULD NOT PERFORM SUCH AS MATCH AS ONLY EXACT OR WILDCARD MATCHES ARE ALLOWED</pattern>
<template>AIML is normally executed as a script, where each pattern either matches or does not match a question. When importing AIML as a chat log, it will not be executed as a script.

<category>
<pattern>IT WILL ALSO LOOKUP EACH WORD FOR ITS MEANING FROM WIKTIONARY AND PROCESS QUESTIONS AND ANSWER THROUGH ITS STATE MACHINES . FOR EXAMPLE THE QUESTION & #34 ; USER : WHAT IS THE EARTH & #34 ; WILL HAVE THE BOT LOOKUP IN FREEBASE ALL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLANET EARTH AND IMPORT THE INFORMATION INTO ITS BRAIN . COMPREHENSION WILL TAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TO IMPORT THE CHAT LOG SO ONLY USE THIS FOR SMALL CHAT LOG FILES THAT YOU WANT THE BOT TO LEARN FROM</pattern>
<template>It will also lookup each word for its meaning from Wiktionary, and process questions and answer through its state machines. For example the question &#34;User: What is the Earth&#34; will have the bot lookup in Freebase all information related to the planet Earth, and import the information into its brain. Comprehension will take significantly longer to import the chat log, so only use this for small chat log files that you want the bot to learn from.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>COMPREHENSION WILL ANALYZE THE QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES AND TRY TO GENERALIZE THE RESPONSES INTO SCRIPTED FORMULA RESPONSES . FOR EXAMPLE IS MAY TAKE THE RESPONSE & #34 ; BOT : MY NAME IS BOT & #34 ; TO BE GENERALIZED TO FORMULA : & #34 ; MY NAME IS { GET #NAME FROM : TARGET } & #34 ; . OR COULD LEARN HOW TO COUNT FROM THE RESPONSE & #34 ; BOT : 2 & #34 ; TO & #34 ; USER : 1 & #34 ;</pattern>
<template>Comprehension will analyze the questions and responses and try to generalize the responses into scripted formula responses. For example is may take the response &#34;Bot: My name is Bot&#34; to be generalized to Formula:&#34;My name is {get #name from :target}&#34;. Or could learn how to count from the response &#34;Bot: 2&#34; to &#34;User: 1&#34;.</template>

<pattern>THIS LOG CONTAINS TWO CONVERSATIONS . WHEN YOU IMPORT THE CHAT LOG THE BOT WILL LEARN THE RESPONSES IN CONTEXT IN THAT IT WILL BOTH RECORD THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS AND THE PREVIOUS RESPONSE . THIS WILL ALLOW THE BOT TO CHOOSE THE BEST RESPONSE FOR QUESTIONS IT KNOWS MULTIPLE RESPONSES TO BASED ON THE CONTEXT . FOR THE EXAMPLE ABOVE IF YOU SAY & #34 ; HELLO & #34 ; THE BOT MAY ANSWER & #34 ; HELLO & #34 ; OR & #34 ; HOW ARE YOU ? & #34 ; HOWEVER IF ITS PREVIOUS RESPONSE WAS & #34 ; HELLO & #34 ; THEN IT WILL ANSWER & #34 ; HOW ARE YOU ? & #34 ; BECAUSE OF THE CONTEXT</pattern>
<template>This log contains two conversations. When you import the chat log, the bot will learn the responses in context, in that it will both record the responses to the questions, and the previous response. This will allow the bot to choose the best response for questions it knows multiple responses to, based on the context. For the example above if you say &#34;Hello&#34; the bot may answer &#34;Hello&#34; or &#34;How are you?&#34;, however if its previous response was &#34;Hello&#34; then it will answer &#34;How are you?&#34; because of the context.</template>

A SCRIPT CAN INCLUDE SELF CODE TO BE EXECUTED WHICH CAN ADD KNOWLEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR BOT & #39 ; S OBJECT DATABASE</pattern>
<template>You can also include keywords, required, previous, topics, and other meta data in a response list. You can also define default responses, greetings, or execute scripts. A default response is used when no other response is known, and a greeting is used as the bot&#39;s first response in a new conversation. A script can include Self code to be executed, which can add knowledge directly to your bot&#39;s object database.</template>

<pattern>IN SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS THE OUTCOME IS NOT UNAMBIGUOUS . THIS HINDERS A DIRECT DERIVATION FROM THE DATA . IN EXPERIMENTS WITH PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITIES RESEARCHERS HAD TO WEAKEN THEIR THESIS THAT PERSONS WITH MISSING ACTIVITY IN THE FRONTAL LOBE ARE PREDETERMINED FOR BEING VIOLENT PSYCHOPATHIC PEOPLE THAT ARE UNETHICAL MURDERERS . MISSING ACTIVITY IN THE FRONTAL LOBE LEADS TO A DISREGULATION OF THRESHOLD FOR EMOTIONAL IMPULSIVE OR VIOLENT ACTIONS . BUT THIS ALSO ADVANTAGES FOR EXAMPLE FIRE FIGHTERS OR POLICEMEN WHO HAVE TO WITHSTAND STRONG PRESSURES AND WHO NEED A HIGHER THRESHOLD . SO MISSING ACTIVITY IS NOT A SUFFICIENT CRITERION FOR PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITIES</pattern>
<template>In several experiments the outcome is not unambiguous. This hinders a direct derivation from the data. In experiments with psychopathic personalities researchers had to weaken their thesis, that persons with missing activity in the frontal lobe are predetermined for being violent psychopathic people, that are unethical murderers. 
Missing activity in the frontal lobe leads to a disregulation of threshold for emotional, impulsive or violent actions. But this also advantages for example fire fighters or policemen, who have to withstand strong pressures and who need a higher threshold. So missing activity is not a sufficient criterion for psychopathic personalities.</template>

<pattern>ABSTRACT [ 3 ] WATCHING ANOTHER PERSON BEING TOUCHED ACTIVATES A SIMILAR NEURAL CIRCUIT TO ACTUAL TOUCH AND FOR SOME PEOPLE WITH MIRROR-TOUCH SYNESTHESIA CAN PRODUCE A FELT TACTILE SENSATION ON THEIR OWN BODY . IN THIS STUDY WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THIS TYPE OF SYNESTHESIA AND SHOW THAT IT CORRELATES WITH HEIGHTENED EMPATHIC ABILITY . THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION THAT WE EMPATHIZE WITH OTHERS THROUGH A PROCESS OF SIMULATION</pattern>
<template>Abstract [3]
Watching another person being touched activates a similar neural circuit to actual touch and, for some people with 'mirror-touch' synesthesia, can produce a felt tactile sensation on their own body. 
In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of this type of synesthesia and show that it correlates with heightened empathic ability. 
This is consistent with the notion that we empathize with others through a process of simulation.</template>

<pattern>THE JOB SATISFACTION – JOB PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY . MANY RESEARCHERS AND MOST LAY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN SATISFACTION AND PERFORMANCE . IN THE CURRENT STUDY HOWEVER ANALYSES USING META-ANALYTIC DATA SUGGESTED THAT THE SATISFACTION – PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP IS LARGELY SPURIOUS . MORE SPECIFICALLY THE SATISFACTION – PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP WAS PARTIALLY ELIMINATED AFTER CONTROLLING FOR EITHER GENERAL PERSONALITY TRAITS ( E.G . FIVE FACTOR MODEL TRAITS AND CORE SELF-EVALUATIONS ) OR FOR WORK LOCUS OF CONTROL AND WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY ELIMINATED AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ORGANIZATION-BASED SELF-ESTEEM . THE PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED</pattern>
<template>The job satisfaction–job performance relationship has attracted much attention throughout the history of industrial and organizational psychology. Many researchers and most lay people believe that a causal relationship exists between satisfaction and performance.
In the current study, however, analyses using meta-analytic data suggested that the satisfaction–performance relationship is largely spurious.
More specifically, the satisfaction–performance relationship was partially eliminated after controlling for either general personality traits (e.g., Five Factor Model traits and core self-evaluations) or for work locus of control and was almost completely eliminated after controlling for organization-based self-esteem.
The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.</template>

<pattern>WE PRESENT TWO BILINGUAL PATIENTS WITHOUT LANGUAGE DISORDERS IN WHOM INVOLUNTARY LANGUAGE SWITCHING WAS INDUCED . THE FIRST PATIENT SWITCHED FROM DUTCH TO ENGLISH DURING A LEFT-SIDED AMOBARBITAL WADA-TEST . FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING YIELDED A PREDOMINANTLY LEFT-SIDED LANGUAGE DISTRIBUTION SIMILAR FOR BOTH LANGUAGES . THE SECOND PATIENT SWITCHED FROM FRENCH TO CHINESE DURING INTRAOPERATIVE ELECTROCORTICAL STIMULATION OF THE LEFT INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS . WE CONCLUDE THAT THE OBSERVED LANGUAGE SWITCHING IN BOTH CASES WAS NOT LIKELY THE RESULT OF A SELECTIVE INHIBITION OF ONE LANGUAGE BUT THE RESULT OF A TEMPORARY DISRUPTION OF BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN LANGUAGE SWITCHING . THESE DATA COMPLEMENT THE FEW LESION STUDIES ON ( INVOLUNTARY OR UNINTENTIONAL ) LANGUAGE SWITCHING AND ADD TO THE FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING STUDIES OF SWITCHING MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE LANGUAGE IN USE</pattern>
<template>We present two bilingual patients without language disorders in whom involuntary language switching was induced. The first patient switched from Dutch to English during a left-sided amobarbital Wada-test. 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging yielded a predominantly left-sided language distribution similar for both languages. 
The second patient switched from French to Chinese during intraoperative electrocortical stimulation of the left inferior frontal gyrus.
We conclude that the observed language switching in both cases was not likely the result of a selective inhibition of one language, but the result of a temporary disruption of brain areas that are involved in language switching.
These data complement the few lesion studies on (involuntary or unintentional) language switching, and add to the functional neuroimaging studies of switching, monitoring, and controlling the language in use.</template>

<pattern>SINCE THE MIND IS A SINGLE SYSTEM IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN IT AS SUCH WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES FOR EVERY APPROACH ( NEUROLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPUTATIONAL ) .

BUT UNTIL NOW THERE IS NO WORKING UNIFYING THEORY OF COGNITION WHICH FULFILS THE REQUIREMENTS STATED BY ALLEN NEWELL IN HIS BOOK UNIFIED THEORIES OF COGNITION . ACCORDINGLY A UTC HAS TO EXPLAIN : HOW INTELLIGENT ORGANISMS RESPOND FLEXIBLY TO THE ENVIRONMENT . HOW THEY EXHIBIT GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOUR AND CHOOSE GOALS RATIONALLY ( AND IN RESPONSE TO INTERRUPTS : SEE PREVIOUS POINT ) . HOW THEY USE SYMBOLS . HOW THEY LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE . EVEN NEWELLS OWN IMPLEMENTATION SOAR DOES NOT REACH THESE GOALS</pattern>
<template>Since the mind is a single system it should be possible to explain it as such without having to take different perspectives for every approach (neurological,psychological,computational).
Having such a theory would enable us to understand our brain far more thorough than now, and might eventually lead an everyday application. 
But until now there is no working Unifying Theory of Cognition, which fulfils the requirements stated by Allen Newell in his book Unified Theories of Cognition. Accordingly a UTC has to explain:
How intelligent organisms respond flexibly to the environment. 
How they exhibit goal-directed behaviour and choose goals rationally (and in response to interrupts: see previous point). 
How they use symbols. 
How they learn from experience. 
Even Newells own implementation SOAR does not reach these goals.</template>

<template>A biological NN  consists of neurons which are physically or functionally connected with each other. Since each neuron can connect to multiple other neurons the number of possible connections is exponentially high. The connections between neurons are called synapses.

PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE IS REPRESENTED BY PRODUCTION RULES IN THE PRODUCTION MEMORY . TEMPORARY KNOWLEDGE IS REPRESENTED BY OBJECTS IN THE WORKING MEMORY . NEW GOALS ARE CREATED ONLY IF A DEAD END IS REACHED . THE LEARNING MECHANISM IS CHUNKING .

SOAR WAS CREATED BY JOHN LAIRD ALLEN NEWELL AND PAUL ROSENBLOOM</pattern>
<template>SOAR is another Cognitive Architecture, an acronym for State, Operator And Result.
It enables one to model complex human capabilities. Its goal is to create an agent with human-like behaviour. The working principles are the following:
Problem-solving is a search in a problem-space.
Permanent Knowledge is represented by production rules in the production memory.
Temporary Knowledge is represented by objects in the working memory.
New Goals are created only if a dead end is reached.
The learning mechanism is Chunking.
Chunking: If SOAR encounters an impasse and is unable to resolve it with the usual technique, it uses “weaker” strategies to circumvent the dead end. In case one of these attempts leads to success,
the respective route is saved as a new rule, a chunk, preventing the impasse to occur again. 
SOAR was created by John Laird, Allen Newell and Paul Rosenbloom.</template>

<template>ACT-R is a Cognitive Architecture, an acronym for Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational.
It provides tools which enable us to model the human cognition. It consists mainly of five components: 
Perceptual-motor modules, declarative memory, procedural memory, chunks and buffers.
The declarative memory stores facts in “knowledge-units”, the chunks.
These are transmitted through the modules respective buffers, which contain one chunk at a time.
The procedural memory is the only one without an own buffer, but is able to access the contents of the other buffers. For example those of the perceptual-motor modules, which are the interface with the (simulated) outer world.
Production is accomplished by predefined rules, written is LISP.

SUCH A PROCEDURE SEEMS TO BE HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE ESPECIALLY IF PUT INTO THE CONTEXT OF AN INVESTIGATION OF BOWERS IN 1973 WHICH SHOWED THAT OVER 30 % OF THE VARIANCE IN SUCH STUDIES ARE DUE TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES OR THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION ( CF .

<template>Another issue concerning experimental setups in cognitive psychology is the way individual differences are handled. In general the results from an experiment are generated by an analysis of variance. This causes that results which are due to individual differences are averaged out and not taken into further consideration. Such a procedure seems to be highly questionable, especially if put into the context of an investigation of Bowers in 1973, which showed that over 30% of the variance in such studies are due to individual differences or their interaction with the current situation (cf. ibid, p. 515). Based on such facts one challenge for future experimental cognitive psychology is the analysis of individual differences and finding way to include knowledge about such differences in general studies.</template>

THIS IS AN INDIRECT MEASURE AS THE METABOLISM IS MEASURED AND NOT THE NEURONAL ACTIVITY ITSELF . FURTHERMORE THIS IMAGING METHOD HAS GOOD SPATIAL RESOLUTION ( WHERE THE ACTIVITY OCCURS ) BUT LOW TEMPORAL RESOLUTION ( WHEN THE ACTIVITY OCCURS ) AS MEASUREMENTS OCCUR AFTER THE NEURONAL ACTIVITY</pattern>

<category>
<pattern>HOW ? IF PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE ACTIVE THE METABOLISM IS ALSO STIMULATED . THE BLOOD THAT HAS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN THE METABOLIC TRANSPORT IS FLOWING TO THE ACTIVE NERVE CELLS . THE HAEMOGLOBIN IN THE RED BLOOD CELLS CARRIES OXYGEN ( OXYHAEMOGLIOBIN ) WHEN FLOWING TO THE PART THAT IS ACTIVE AND THAT NEEDS OXYGEN TO CONSUME AND WORK . WITH CONSUMPTION THE HAEMOGLOBIN „ DELIVERS “ THE OXYGEN ( DESOXYHAEMOGLOBIN ) . THIS LEADS TO LOCAL CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF OXYHEMOGLOBIN AND DESOXYHEMOGLOBIN AND CHANGES IN LOCAL BLOOD VOLUME AND BLOOD FLOW . WHILE HAEMOGLOBIN IS OXYGENATED IT IS DIAMAGNETIC ( MEANING THE MATERIAL TENDS TO LEAVE THE MAGNETIC FIELD ) BUT PARAMAGNETIC ( MATERIAL TENDS TO MIGRATE INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD ) WHILE DESOXYGENATED . THE MAGNETIC RESONANCE SIGNAL OF BLOOD IS THEREFORE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OXYGENATION</pattern>
<template>How?
If parts of the brain are active, the metabolism is also stimulated. The blood, that has an important function in the metabolic transport is flowing to the active nerve cells. The haemoglobin in the red blood cells carries oxygen (oxyhaemogliobin) when flowing to the part that is active and that needs oxygen, to consume and work. With consumption the haemoglobin „delivers“ the oxygen (desoxyhaemoglobin). This leads to local changes in the relative concentration of oxyhemoglobin and desoxyhemoglobin and changes in local blood volume and blood flow. While haemoglobin is oxygenated it is diamagnetic (meaning the material tends to leave the magnetic field), but paramagnetic (material tends to migrate into the magnetic field) while desoxygenated. The magnetic resonance signal of blood is therefore slightly different depending on the level of oxygenation.</template>

THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IS CLEAR : DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE TOPIC MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TEST HYPOTHESES USING DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND TO EVENTUALLY DEVELOP NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS FOR THINKING ABOUT THE MIND . OFTEN MODERN STUDIES OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY CRITICISE CLASSICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING APPROACHES WHICH OPENS THE DOOR FOR OTHER APPROACHES TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL IMPORTANCE .

<template>Cognitive psychology, however, does not only rely on methods developed by other branches of science. It also collaborates with closely related fields, including artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics and the philosophy of mind. The advantage of this multidisciplinary approach is clear: different perspectives on the topic make it possible to test hypotheses using different techniques and to eventually develop new conceptual frameworks for thinking about the mind. Often, modern studies of cognitive psychology criticise classical information processing approaches, which opens the door for other approaches to acquire additional importance. For example, the classical approach has been modified to a parallel information processing approach, which is thought to be closer to the actual functioning of the brain.</template>

<pattern>IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT REASONING AND DECISION MAKING ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER : DECISION MAKING IN MANY CASES HAPPENS WITH A PREVIOUS PROCESS OF REASONING . PEOPLE S EVERYDAY LIFE IS DECISIVELY COINED BY THE SYNCHRONIZED APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO HUMAN COGNITIVE FEATURES . THIS SYNCHRONIZATION IN TURN IS REALIZED BY THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS WHICH SEEM TO BE MAINLY LOCATED IN THE FRONTAL LOBES OF THE BRAIN</pattern>
<template>It is important to keep in mind that reasoning and decision making are closely connected to each other: Decision making in many cases happens with a previous process of reasoning. People's everyday life is decisively coined by the synchronized appearance of these two human cognitive features. This synchronization, in turn, is realized by the executive functions which seem to be mainly located in the frontal lobes of the brain.</template>

<pattern>THE PERSPECTIVE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING INTRODUCED AN APPROACH WHICH ASSUMES THAT EACH PERSON HAS A GOAL LIST WHICH CONTAINS THE TASKS REQUIREMENTS OR GOALS . THIS LIST IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GUIDING BEHAVIOR AND SINCE FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGES DISRUPT THE ABILITY TO FORM A GOAL LIST THE THEORY HELPS TO EXPLAIN DIFFICULTIES IN ABSTRACT THINKING PERCEPTUAL ANALYSIS VERBAL OUTPUT AND STAYING ON TASK . IT CAN ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE ON PATIENTS WITH FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGES DUE TO THE LACK OF INTERNAL GOALS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF ORGANIZING ACTIONS TOWARD A GOAL</pattern>
<template>The perspective of artificial intelligence and machine learning introduced an approach which assumes that each person has a goal list, which contains the tasks requirements or goals. This list is fundamental to guiding behavior and since frontal lobe damages disrupt the ability to form a goal list, the theory helps to explain difficulties in abstract thinking, perceptual analysis, verbal output and staying on task. It can also account for the strong environmental influence on patients with frontal lobe damages, due to the lack of internal goals and the difficulty of organizing actions toward a goal.</template>

<pattern>STUSS AND BENSON ( 1986 ) CONSIDER CONTROL OVER BEHAVIOR TO OCCUR IN A HIERARCHICAL MANNER . THEY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WHICH EACH IS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR BRAIN REGION . IN THE FIRST LEVEL SENSORY INFORMATION IS PROCESSED AUTOMATICALLY BY POSTERIOR REGIONS IN THE NEXT LEVEL ( ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE FRONTAL LOBE ) CONSCIOUS CONTROL IS NEEDED TO DIRECT BEHAVIOR TOWARD A GOAL AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL CONTROLLED SELF-REFLECTION TAKES PLACE IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX</pattern>
<template>Stuss and Benson (1986) consider control over behavior to occur in a hierarchical manner. They distinguish between three different levels, of which each is associated with a particular brain region. In the first level sensory information is processed automatically by posterior regions, in the next level (associated with the executive functions of the frontal lobe) conscious control is needed to direct behavior toward a goal and at the highest level controlled self-reflection takes place in the prefrontal cortex.</template>

<pattern>THERE ARE TWO THEORIES BASED ON THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION THAT THE FRONTAL LOBES ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR IN NON-EXPERIENCED SITUATIONS AND FOR OVERRIDING STIMULUS-RESPONSE ASSOCIATIONS BUT CONTRIBUTE LITTLE TO AUTOMATIC AND EFFORTLESS BEHAVIOR ( BANICH 1997 )</pattern>

<category>
<pattern>WE START BY DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF THE LOSS OF THE ABILITY TO START SOMETHING TO INITIATE AN ACTION . A PERSON WITH EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION IS LIKELY TO HAVE TROUBLE BEGINNING TO WORK ON A TASK WITHOUT STRONG HELP FROM THE OUTSIDE WHILE PEOPLE WITH LEFT FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE OFTEN SHOW IMPAIRED SPONTANEOUS SPEECH AND PEOPLE WITH RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE RATHER SHOW POOR NONVERBAL FLUENCY . OF COURSE ONE REASON IS THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON WILL NOT HAVE ANY INTENTION DESIRE OR CONCERN ON HIS OR HER OWN OF SOLVING THE TASK SINCE THIS IS YET ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION . BUT IT IS ALSO DUE TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OFTEN CONNECTED WITH THE LOSS OF PROPERLY EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING : PSYCHOLOGICAL INERTIA . LIKE IN PHYSICS INERTIA IN THIS CASE MEANS THAT AN ACTION IS VERY HARD TO INITIATE BUT ONCE STARTED IT IS AGAIN VERY HARD TO SHIFT OR STOP . THIS PHENOMENON IS CHARACTERIZED BY ENGAGEMENT IN REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR IS CALLED PERSEVERATION ( CP . WCST )</pattern>
<template>We start by describing the effects of the loss of the ability to start something, to initiate an action. A person with executive dysfunction is likely to have trouble beginning to work on a task without strong help from the outside, while people with left frontal lobe damage often show impaired spontaneous speech and people with right frontal lobe damage rather show poor nonverbal fluency. Of course, one reason is the fact that this person will not have any intention, desire or concern on his or her own of solving the task since this is yet another characteristic of executive dysfunction. But it is also due to a psychological effect often connected with the loss of properly executive functioning: Psychological inertia.
Like in physics, inertia in this case means that an action is very hard to initiate, but once started, it is again very hard to shift or stop. This phenomenon is characterized by engagement in repetitive behavior, is called perseveration (cp. WCST).</template>

<pattern>WILKINS SHALLICE AND MCCARTHY ( 1987 ) WERE ABLE TO PROVE A CONNECTION BETWEEN DANGEROUS OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AS PATIENTS WITH LESIONS TO THIS AREA WERE IMPAIRED DURING EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING DANGEROUS OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS . THE VENTROMEDIAL AND ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE ASPECTS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS</pattern>
<template>Wilkins, Shallice and McCarthy (1987) were able to prove a connection between dangerous or difficult situations and the prefrontal cortex, as patients with lesions to this area were impaired during experiments concerning dangerous or difficult situations. The ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex may be particularly important for these aspects of executive functions.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ONE SINGLE MISTAKE IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION MAY EASILY LEAD TO SERIOUS INJURIES WHILE A MISTAKE IN A TECHNICAL DIFFICULT SITUATION ( E.G . BUILDING A HOUSE OF CARDS ) WOULD OBVIOUSLY LEAD TO FAILURE . THUS IN SUCH SITUATIONS AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION OF RESPONSES CLEARLY WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR SUCH PROBLEMS</pattern>
<template>One single mistake in a dangerous situation may easily lead to serious injuries while a mistake in a technical difficult situation (e.g. building a house of cards) would obviously lead to failure.

PATIENTS WITH LEFT LATERAL PREFRONTAL LESIONS ARE OFTEN IMPAIRED ( STUSS ET AL . 1998 )</pattern>
<template>In the FAS Test (Miller, 1984) subjects have to generate sequences of words (not proper names) beginning with a certain letter (“F” , “A” or “S”) in a one-minute period.

<category>
<pattern>THESE EARLIER DESCRIBED PROBLEMS OF REDIRECTING OF ONE S STRATEGIES STAND IN CONTRAST TO THE ACTUAL ACT OF SWITCHING BETWEEN TASKS . THIS IS YET ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR PATIENTS WITH FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE . SINCE THE CONTROL SYSTEM THAT LEADS TASK SWITCHING AS SUCH IS INDEPENDENT FROM THE PARTS THAT ACTUALLY PERFORM THESE TASKS THE TASK SWITCHING IS PARTICULARLY IMPAIRED IN PATIENTS WITH LESIONS TO THE DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH PERFORMING THE SINGLE TASKS ALONE . THIS OF COURSE CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE AS IT WAS SAID BEFORE : MOST TASKS CONSIST OF SMALLER SUBTASKS THAT HAVE TO BE COMPLETED</pattern>
<template>These earlier described problems of 'redirecting' of one's strategies stand in contrast to the actual 'act of switching' between tasks. This is yet another problem for patients with frontal lobe damage. Since the control system that leads task switching as such is independent from the parts that actually perform these tasks, the task switching is particularly impaired in patients with lesions to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while at the same time they have no trouble with performing the single tasks alone. This of course, causes a lot of problems in goal directed behavior because as it was said before: Most tasks consist of smaller subtasks that have to be completed.</template>

<category>
<pattern>MOREOVER SUCH PERSONS DO NOT USE AS MANY APPROPRIATE HYPOTHESES FOR CREATING A STRATEGY AS PEOPLE WITH DAMAGE TO OTHER BRAIN REGIONS DO . IN WHAT PARTICULAR WAY THIS CAN BE OBSERVED IN PATIENTS CAN AGAIN NOT BE STATED IN GENERAL BUT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE SHIFT THAT HAS TO BE MADE</pattern>
<template>Moreover, such persons do not use as many appropriate hypotheses for creating a strategy as people with damage to other brain regions do. In what particular way this can be observed in patients can again not be stated in general but depends on the nature of the shift that has to be made.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>INTACT NEURONAL TISSUE IN THE FRONTAL LOBE IS ALSO CRUCIAL FOR ANOTHER EXECUTIVE FUNCTION CONNECTED WITH GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR THAT WE DESCRIBED ABOVE : FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY . THIS MEANS THAT PERSONS WITH FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE WILL HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN SHIFTING THEIR WAY OF THINKING – MEANING CREATING A NEW PLAN AFTER RECOGNIZING THAT THE ORIGINAL ONE CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT FOR SOME REASON . THUS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MODIFY THEIR STRATEGY ACCORDING TO THIS NEW PROBLEM . EVEN WHEN IT IS CLEAR THAT ONE HYPOTHESIS CANNOT BE THE RIGHT ONE TO SOLVE A TASK PATIENTS WILL STICK TO IT NEVERTHELESS AND ARE UNABLE TO ABANDON IT ( CALLED TUNNEL VISION )</pattern>
<template>Intact neuronal tissue in the frontal lobe is also crucial for another executive function connected with goal directed behavior that we described above: Flexibility and adaptability. This means that persons with frontal lobe damage will have difficulties in shifting their way of thinking – meaning  creating a new plan after recognizing that the original one cannot be carried out for some reason. Thus, they are not able to modify their strategy according to this new problem. Even when it is clear that one hypothesis cannot be the right one to solve a task, patients will stick to it nevertheless and are unable to abandon it (called 'tunnel vision').</template>

THEN AT SOME POINT AFTER THE PARTICIPANT HAS FOUND THE CORRECT RULE TO SORT THE CARDS THE EXPERIMENTER CHANGES THE RULE AND THE PREVIOUS CORRECT SORTING WILL LEAD TO NEGATIVE FEEDBACK . THE PARTICIPANT HAS TO REALIZE THE CHANGE AND ADAPT TO IT BY SORTING THE CARDS ACCORDING TO THE NEW RULE</pattern>
<template>The most famous experiment to investigate error correction and trouble shooting is the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). A participant is presented with cards that show certain objects. These cards are defined by shape, color and number of the objects on the cards. These cards now have to be sorted according to a rule based on one of these three criteria. The participant does not know which rule is the right one but has to reach the conclusion after positive or negative feedback of the experimenter. Then at some point, after the participant has found the correct rule to sort the cards, the experimenter changes the rule and the previous correct sorting will lead to negative feedback. The participant has to realize the change and adapt to it by sorting the cards according to the new rule.</template>

<pattern>HOWEVER IN THE END WE MUST ADD THAT ALTHOUGH EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION CAUSES AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN BEHAVING CORRECTLY TOWARDS A GOAL MOST PATIENTS WHEN ASSIGNED WITH A TASK ARE INDEED ANXIOUS TO SOLVE IT BUT ARE JUST UNABLE TO DO SO</pattern>

<pattern>ANOTHER IMPORTANT BRAIN REGION IN THIS CONTEXT – THE MEDIAL PORTION OF THE FRONTAL LOBE – IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DETECTING BEHAVIORAL ERRORS MADE WHILE WORKING TOWARDS A GOAL . THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN BY ERP EXPERIMENTS WHERE THERE WAS AN ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY 100MS AFTER AN ERROR HAS BEEN MADE . IF THIS AREA IS DAMAGED THIS MECHANISM CANNOT WORK PROPERLY ANY MORE AND THE PATIENT LOSES THE ABILITY TO DETECT ERRORS AND THUS MONITOR HIS OWN BEHAVIOR</pattern>

<pattern>THE LAST PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WITH FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE WE WANT TO PRESENT HERE IS THE LAST POINT IN THE ABOVE LIST OF PROPERTIES IMPORTANT FOR PROPER GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR . IT IS THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE ONE S ACTIONS AN ABILITY THAT IS MISSING IN MOST PATIENTS . THESE PEOPLE ARE THEREFORE VERY LIKELY TO WANDER OFF TASK AND ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT DOES NOT HELP THEM TO ATTAIN THEIR GOAL . IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY ARE ALSO NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR TASK IS ALREADY COMPLETED AT ALL . REASONS FOR THIS ARE THOUGHT TO BE A LACK OF MOTIVATION OR LACK OF CONCERN ABOUT ONE S PERFORMANCE ( FRONTAL LOBE DAMAGE IS USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN EMOTIONAL PROCESSING ) BUT THESE ARE PROBABLY NOT THE ONLY EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE PROBLEMS</pattern>
<template>The last problem for people with frontal lobe damage we want to present here is the last point in the above list of properties important for proper goal directed behavior. It is the ability to evaluate one's actions, an ability that is missing in most patients. These people are therefore very likely to 'wander off task' and engage in behavior that does not help them to attain their goal. In addition to that, they are also not able to determine whether their task is already completed at all. Reasons for this are thought to be a lack of motivation or lack of concern about one's performance (frontal lobe damage is usually accompanied by changes in emotional processing) but these are probably not the only explanations for these problems.</template>

<pattern>QUITE OFTEN IF WE WANT TO REACH A GOAL WE GET HINTS ON HOW TO DO IT BEST . THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO INTERPRET THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY WOULD BE . FOR MANY PATIENTS OF EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO EITHER . THEY HAVE TROUBLE TO USE THIS INFORMATION AND ENGAGE IN INEFFICIENT ACTIONS . THUS IT WILL TAKE THEM MUCH LONGER TO SOLVE A TASK THAN HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO USE THE EXTRA INFORMATION AND DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY</pattern>
<template>Quite often, if we want to reach a goal, we get hints on how to do it best. This means we have to be able to interpret the available information in terms of what the appropriate strategy would be. For many patients of executive dysfunction this is not an easy thing to do either. They have trouble to use this information and engage in inefficient actions. Thus, it will take them much longer to solve a task than healthy people who use the extra information and develop an effective strategy.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>BUT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING THERE IS TO SEQUENCING . FOR REACHING A GOAL IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT A PERSON IS ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS WHICH STRATEGY BEST SUITS THE PURPOSE IN ADDITION TO JUST BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP A CORRECT SEQUENCE . THIS IS PROVEN BY AN EXPERIMENT CALLED TOWER OF LONDON ( SHALLICE 1982 ) WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE FAMOUS TOWER OF HANOI TASK WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT THIS TASK REQUIRED THREE BALLS TO BE PUT ONTO THREE POLES OF DIFFERENT LENGTH SO THAT ONE POLE COULD HOLD THREE BALLS THE SECOND ONE TWO AND THE THIRD ONE ONLY ONE BALL IN A WAY THAT A CHANGEABLE GOAL POSITION IS ATTAINED OUT OF A FIXED INITIAL POSITION IN AS FEW MOVES AS POSSIBLE . ESPECIALLY PATIENTS WITH DAMAGE TO THE LEFT FRONTAL LOBE PROVED TO WORK INEFFICIENTLY AND INEFFECTIVELY ON THIS TASK . THEY NEEDED MANY MOVES AND ENGAGED IN ACTIONS THAT DID NOT LEAD TOWARD THE GOAL</pattern>
<template>But this is not the only thing there is to sequencing. For reaching a goal in the best possible way it is important that a person is able to figure out which sequence of actions, which strategy, best suits the purpose, in addition to just being able to develop a correct sequence. This is proven by an experiment called 'Tower of London' (Shallice, 1982) which is similar to the famous 'Tower of Hanoi' task with the difference that this task required three balls to be put onto three poles of different length so that one pole could hold three balls, the second one two and the third one only one ball, in a way that a changeable goal position is attained out of a fixed initial position in as few moves as possible. Especially patients with damage to the left frontal lobe proved to work inefficiently and ineffectively on this task. They needed many moves and engaged in actions that did not lead toward the goal.</template>

<pattern>THE FRONTAL LOBE IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR SEQUENCING BUT ALSO THOUGHT TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE FOR WORKING MEMORY . THIS IDEA IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT LESIONS IN THE LATERAL REGIONS OF THE FRONTAL LOBE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF KEEPING THINGS IN MIND THAN DAMAGE TO OTHER AREAS OF THE FRONTAL CORTEX DO</pattern>
<template>The frontal lobe is not only important for sequencing but also thought to play a major role for working memory. This idea is supported by the fact that lesions in the lateral regions of the frontal lobe are much more likely to impair the ability of 'keeping things in mind' than damage to other areas of the frontal cortex do.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ANOTHER INTERESTING RESULT WAS THE FACT THAT LESIONS IN THE FRONTAL LOBES OF LEFT AND RIGHT HEMISPHERE IMPAIRED DIFFERENT ABILITIES . WHILE A LESION IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE CAUSED TROUBLE IN MAKING RECENCY JUDGEMENTS A LESION IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE IMPAIRED THE PATIENT ’ S PERFORMANCE ONLY WHEN THE PRESENTED MATERIAL WAS VERBAL OR IN A VARIATION OF THE EXPERIMENT THAT REQUIRED SELF-ORDERED SEQUENCING . BECAUSE OF THAT WE KNOW THAT THE ABILITY TO SEQUENCE BEHAVIOUR IS NOT ONLY LOCATED IN THE FRONTAL LOBE BUT IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO MOTOR ACTION</pattern>
<template>Another interesting result was the fact that lesions in the frontal lobes of left and right hemisphere impaired different abilities. While a lesion in the right hemisphere caused trouble in making recency judgements, a lesion in the left hemisphere impaired the patient’s performance only when the presented material was verbal or in a variation of the experiment that required self-ordered sequencing. Because of that we know that the ability to sequence behaviour is not only located in the frontal lobe but in the left hemisphere particularly when it comes to motor action.</template>

<category>
<pattern>THE BREAKDOWN OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS IMPAIRS GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR TO A LARGE EXTEND . IN WHICH WAY CANNOT BE STATED IN GENERAL IT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS THAT ARE DAMAGED . SO IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A PARTICULAR LESION HAS PROBLEMS WITH TWO OR THREE OF THE FIVE POINTS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND PERFORMS WITHIN AVERAGE REGIONS WHEN THE OTHER ABILITIES ARE TESTED . HOWEVER IF ONLY ONE LINK IS MISSING FROM THE CHAIN THE WHOLE PLAN MIGHT GET VERY HARD OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO MASTER . FURTHERMORE THE PARTICULAR HEMISPHERE AFFECTED PLAYS A ROLE AS WELL</pattern>
<template>The breakdown of executive functions impairs goal directed behavior to a large extend. In which way cannot be stated in general, it depends on the specific brain regions that are damaged. So it is quite possible that an individual with a particular lesion has problems with two or three of the five points described above and performs within average regions when the other abilities are tested. However, if only one link is missing from the chain, the whole plan might get very hard or even impossible to master. Furthermore, the particular hemisphere affected plays a role as well.</template>

However, dividing intelligence into crystallised intelligence (based on previously acquired knowledge) and fluid intelligence (meant to rely on the current ability of solving problems), emphasizes the executive power of the frontal lobes, as patients with lesions in these regions performed significantly worse in tests of fluid intelligence (Duncan, Burgess & Emslie, 1995).</template>

<pattern>NEVERTHELESS WE WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE PREFRONTAL REGIONS OF THE FRONTAL LOBES TO GET AN IMPRESSION OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS WITHIN COGNITION . MOREOVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO SUBDIVIDE THESE REGIONS INTO FUNCTIONAL PARTS . BUT IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT NOT ALL RESEARCHERS REGARD THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AS CONTAINING FUNCTIONALLY DIFFERENT REGIONS</pattern>
<template>Nevertheless, we will concentrate on the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes, to get an impression of the important role of the executive functions within cognition. Moreover, it is possible to subdivide these regions into functional parts. But it is to be noted that not all researchers regard the prefrontal cortex as containing functionally different regions.</template>

<pattern>LOCATING THOSE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS IS RATHER DIFFICULT AS THEY CANNOT BE APPOINTED TO A SINGLE BRAIN REGION .

<template>Locating those executive functions is rather difficult, as they cannot be appointed to a single brain region. Traditionally, they have been equated with the frontal lobes, or rather the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes; but it is still an open question whether all of their aspects can be associated with these regions.</template>

<category>
<pattern>SUBSEQUENTLY THE QUESTION ARISES HOW THIS COGNITIVE ABILITY OF MAKING DECISIONS IS REALIZED IN THE HUMAN BRAIN . AS WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT TASKS INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE PROCESS THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT COORDINATES AND CONTROLS THOSE BRAIN ACTIVITIES – NAMELY THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS . THEY ARE THE BRAIN S CONDUCTOR INSTRUCTING OTHER BRAIN REGIONS TO PERFORM OR BE SILENCED AND GENERALLY COORDINATING THEIR SYNCHRONIZED ACTIVITY ( GOLDBERG 2001 ) . THUS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OPTIMIZING THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL “ MULTI-THREADED ” COGNITIVE TASKS</pattern>
<template>Subsequently, the question arises how this cognitive ability of making decisions is realized in the human brain. As we already know that there are a couple of different tasks involved  in the whole process, there has to be something that coordinates and controls those brain activities – namely the executive functions. They are the brain's conductor, instructing other brain regions to perform, or be silenced, and generally coordinating their synchronized activity (Goldberg, 2001). Thus, they are responsible for optimizing the performance of all “multi-threaded” cognitive tasks.</template>

<category>
<pattern>ANOTHER MISLEADING EFFECT IS THE SO-CALLED FOCUSING ILLUSION . BY CONSIDERING ONLY THE MOST OBVIOUS ASPECTS IN ORDER TO MAKE A CERTAIN DECISION ( E.G . THE WEATHER ) PEOPLE OFTEN NEGLECT VARIOUS REALLY IMPORTANT OUTCOMES ( E.G . CIRCUMSTANCES AT WORK ) . THIS EFFECT OCCURS MORE OFTEN IF PEOPLE JUDGE ABOUT OTHERS COMPARED WITH JUDGMENTS ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVING</pattern>
<template>Another misleading effect is the so-called focusing illusion.  By considering only the most obvious aspects in order to make a  certain decision (e.g. the weather) people often neglect various really important outcomes (e.g. circumstances at work). This effect occurs more often, if people judge about others compared with judgments about their own living.</template>

<template>But even respecting the considerations above there might still be problems to make the “right” decision because of different misleading effects, which mainly arise because of the constraints of inductive reasoning.

<pattern>THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING CONSTANTLY GOES ALONG WITH SITUATIONS IN DAILY LIFE . THINKING ABOUT KNUT AGAIN WE CAN IMAGINE HIM TO DECIDE BETWEEN PACKING MORE BLUE OR MORE GREEN SHIRTS FOR HIS VACATION ( WHICH WOULD ONLY HAVE MINOR CONSEQUENCES ) BUT ALSO ABOUT APPLYING A SPECIFIC JOB OR HAVING CHILDREN WITH HIS WIFE ( WHICH WOULD HAVE RELEVANT INFLUENCE ON IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS FUTURE LIFE ) . THE MENTIONED EXAMPLES ARE BOTH CHARACTERIZED BY PERSONAL DECISIONS WHEREAS PROFESSIONAL DECISIONS DEALING FOR EXAMPLE WITH ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL ISSUES ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT</pattern>
<template>The psychological process of decision making constantly goes along with situations in daily life. Thinking about Knut again we can imagine him to decide between packing more blue or more green shirts for his vacation (which would only have minor consequences) but also about applying a specific job or having children with his wife (which would have relevant influence on important circumstances of his future life). The mentioned examples are both characterized by personal decisions, whereas professional decisions, dealing for example with economic or political issues, are just as important.</template>

<template>The table below (Figure 7) summarises the most prevalent properties and differences between deductive and inductive reasoning which are important to keep in mind.</template>

<category>
<pattern>ALL OF THESE CASES ARE CONCLUSIONS DERIVED FROM PROCESSES OF INDUCTIVE REASONING . ACCORDINGLY ONE ASSUMES THAT THE CHAIR ONE IS SITTING ON DOES NOT COLLAPSE AS THE CHAIRS ON WHICH ONE SAT BEFORE DID NOT COLLAPSE . THIS DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THE CHAIR DOES NOT BREAK INTO PIECES BUT NEVERTHELESS IT IS A RATHER HELPFUL CONCLUSION TO ASSUME THAT THE CHAIR REMAINS STABLE AS THIS IS VERY PROBABLE . TO SUM IT UP INDUCTIVE REASONING IS RATHER ADVANTAGEOUS IN SITUATIONS WHERE DEDUCTIVE REASONING IS JUST NOT APPLICABLE BECAUSE ONLY EVIDENCE BUT NO PROVED FACTS ARE AVAILABLE . AS THESE SITUATIONS OCCUR RATHER OFTEN IN EVERYDAY LIFE LIVING WITHOUT THE USE OF INDUCTIVE REASONING IS INCONCEIVABLE</pattern>
<template>All of these cases are conclusions derived from processes of inductive reasoning. Accordingly, one assumes that the chair one is sitting on does not collapse as the chairs on which one sat before did not collapse. This does not ensure that the chair does not break into pieces but nevertheless it is a rather helpful conclusion to assume that the chair remains stable as this is very probable. To sum it up, inductive reasoning is rather advantageous in situations where deductive reasoning is just not applicable because only evidence but no proved facts are available. As these situations occur rather often in everyday life, living without the use of inductive reasoning is inconceivable.</template>

<pattern>BUT INDUCTIVE REASONS ARE IMPORTANT NEVERTHELESS BECAUSE THEY ACT AS SHORTCUTS FOR OUR REASONING . IT IS MUCH EASIER AND FASTER TO APPLY THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC OR THE REPRESENTATIVENESS HEURISTIC TO A PROBLEM THAN TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CURRENT TOPIC AND DRAW A CONCLUSION BY USING LOGICAL RULES</pattern>
<template>But inductive reasons are important nevertheless because they act as shortcuts for our reasoning. It is much easier and faster to apply the availability heuristic or the representativeness heuristic to a problem than to take into account all information concerning the current topic and draw a conclusion by using logical rules.</template>

<pattern>ALL THE MENTIONED FACTORS INFLUENCE THE SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT SO THAT IT DIFFERS FROM THE ACTUAL PROBABILITY ( PROBABILITY HEURISTIC ) . OF COURSE ALL OF THESE FACTORS DO NOT ALWAYS APPEAR ALONE BUT THEY INFLUENCE ONE ANOTHER AND CAN OCCUR IN COMBINATION DURING THE PROCESS OF REASONING</pattern>
<template>All the mentioned factors influence the subjective probability of an event so that it differs from the actual probability (probability heuristic).
Of course all of these factors do not always appear alone, but they influence one another and can occur in combination during the process of reasoning.</template>

<category>
<pattern>THIS PHENOMENON DESCRIBES THE FACT THAT PEOPLE TEND TO DECIDE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THEMSELVES BELIEVE TO BE TRUE OR GOOD . IF FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE BELIEVES THAT ONE HAS BAD LUCK ON FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH HE WILL ESPECIALLY LOOK FOR EVERY NEGATIVE HAPPENING AT THIS PARTICULAR DATE BUT WILL BE INATTENTIVE TO NEGATIVE HAPPENINGS ON OTHER DAYS . THIS BEHAVIOUR STRENGTHENS THE BELIEF THAT THERE EXISTS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH AND HAVING BAD LUCK . THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS THAT THE ACTUAL INFORMATION IS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT TO COME TO A CONCLUSION BUT ONLY THE INFORMATION WHICH SUPPORTS ONE S OWN BELIEF . THIS EFFECT LEADS TO ERRORS AS PEOPLE TEND TO REASON IN A SUBJECTIVE MANNER IF PERSONAL INTERESTS AND BELIEFS ARE INVOLVED</pattern>
<template>This phenomenon describes the fact that people tend to decide in terms of what they themselves believe to be true or good. If, for example, someone believes that one has bad luck on Friday the thirteenth, he will especially look for every negative happening at this particular date but will be inattentive to negative happenings on other days. This behaviour strengthens the belief that there exists a relationship between Friday the thirteenth and having bad luck. This example shows that the actual information is not taken into account to come to a conclusion but only the information which supports one's own belief.
This effect leads to errors as people tend to reason in a subjective manner, if personal interests and beliefs are involved.</template>

<category>
<pattern>BUT IT IS IN FACT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT SOMEBODY IS JUST A BANK TELLER THAN IT IS THAT SOMEONE IS A FEMINIST IN ADDITION TO BEING A BANK TELLER . THIS EFFECT IS ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 6 WHERE THE GREEN SQUARE WHICH STANDS FOR JUST BEING A BANK TELLER IS MUCH LARGER AND THUS MORE PROBABLE THAN THE SMALLER VIOLET SQUARE WHICH DISPLAYS THE CONJUNCTION OF BANK TELLERS AND FEMINISTS WHICH IS A SUBSET OF BANK TELLERS</pattern>
<template>But it is in fact much more likely that somebody is just a bank teller than it is that someone is a feminist in addition to being a bank teller. This effect is illustrated in figure 6 where the green square, which stands for just being a bank teller, is much larger and thus more probable than the smaller violet square, which displays the conjunction of bank tellers and feminists, which is a subset of bank tellers.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE REPRESENTATIVENESS HEURISTIC ALSO LEADS TO ERRORS IN REASONING IN CASES WHERE THE CONJUNCTION RULE IS VIOLATED . THIS RULE STATES THAT THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO EVENTS IS NEVER MORE LIKELY TO BE THE CASE THAN THE SINGLE EVENTS ALONE . AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS IS THE CASE OF THE FEMINIST BANK TELLER ( TVERSKY & KAHNEMAN 1983 ) . IF WE ARE INTRODUCED TO A WOMAN OF WHOM WE KNOW THAT SHE IS VERY INTERESTED IN WOMEN ’ S RIGHTS AND HAS PARTICIPATED IN MANY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN COLLEGE AND WE ARE TO DECIDE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT SHE IS A BANK TELLER OR A FEMINIST BANK TELLER WE ARE DRAWN TO CONCLUDE THE LATTER AS THE FACTS WE HAVE LEARNT ABOUT HER RESEMBLE THE EVENT OF A FEMINIST BANK TELLER MORE THAN THE EVENT OF ONLY BEING A BANK TELLER</pattern>
<template>The representativeness heuristic also leads to errors in reasoning in cases where the conjunction rule is violated. This rule states that the conjunction of two events is never more likely to be the case than the single events alone. An example for this is the case of the feminist bank teller (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983). If we are introduced to a woman of whom we know that she is very interested in women’s rights and has participated in many political activities in college and we are to decide whether it is more likely that she is a bank teller or a feminist bank teller, we are drawn to conclude the latter as the facts we have learnt about her resemble the event of a feminist bank teller more than the event of only being a bank teller.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ANOTHER EFFECT OF THE USAGE OF THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC IS CALLED ILLUSORY CORRELATIONS . PEOPLE TEND TO JUDGE ACCORDING TO STEREOTYPES . IT SEEMS TO THEM THAT THERE ARE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CERTAIN EVENTS WHICH IN REALITY DO NOT EXIST . THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN BY THE TERM “ PREJUDICE ” . IT MEANS THAT A MUCH OVERSIMPLIFIED GENERALIZATION ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE IS MADE . USUALLY A CORRELATION SEEMS TO EXIST BETWEEN NEGATIVE FEATURES AND A CERTAIN CLASS OF PEOPLE ( OFTEN FRINGE GROUPS ) . IF FOR EXAMPLE ONE S NEIGHBOUR IS JOBLESS AND VERY LAZY ONE TENDS TO CORRELATE THESE TWO ATTRIBUTES AND TO CREATE THE PREJUDICE THAT ALL JOBLESS PEOPLE ARE LAZY . THIS ILLUSORY CORRELATION OCCURS BECAUSE ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT INFORMATION WHICH IS AVAILABLE AND JUDGES THIS TO BE PREVALENT IN MANY CASES</pattern>
<template>Another effect of the usage of the availability heuristic is called illusory correlations. People tend to judge according to stereotypes. It seems to them that there are correlations between certain events which in reality do not exist. This is what is known by the term “prejudice”. It means that a much oversimplified generalization about a group of people is made. Usually a correlation seems to exist between negative features and a certain class of people (often fringe groups). 
If, for example, one's neighbour is jobless and very lazy one tends to correlate these two attributes and to create the prejudice that all jobless people are lazy. This illusory correlation occurs because one takes into account information which is available and judges this to be prevalent in many cases.</template>

<category>
<pattern>THINGS THAT ARE MORE EASILY REMEMBERED ARE JUDGED TO BE MORE PREVALENT . AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT DONE BY LICHTENSTEIN ET AL . ( 1978 ) . THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO CHOOSE FROM TWO DIFFERENT LISTS THE CAUSES OF DEATH WHICH OCCUR MORE OFTEN . BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC PEOPLE JUDGED MORE “ SPECTACULAR ” CAUSES LIKE HOMICIDE OR TORNADO TO CAUSE MORE DEATHS THAN OTHERS LIKE ASTHMA . THE REASON FOR THE SUBJECTS ANSWERING IN SUCH A WAY IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE FILMS AND NEWS IN TELEVISION ARE VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECTACULAR AND INTERESTING CAUSES OF DEATH . THIS IS WHY THESE INFORMATION ARE MUCH MORE AVAILABLE TO THE SUBJECTS IN THE EXPERIMENT</pattern>
<template>Things that are more easily remembered are judged to be more prevalent. An example for this is an experiment done by Lichtenstein et al. (1978). The participants were asked to choose from two different lists the causes of death which occur more often. Because of the availability heuristic people judged more “spectacular” causes like homicide or tornado to cause more deaths than others, like asthma.
The reason for the subjects answering in such a way is that for example films and news in television are very often about spectacular and interesting causes of death. This is why these information are much more available to the subjects in the experiment.</template>

<pattern>IN A PROCESS OF INDUCTIVE REASONING PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE USE OF CERTAIN HEURISTICS WHICH LEAD IN MANY CASES QUICKLY TO ADEQUATE CONCLUSIONS BUT SOMETIMES MAY CAUSE ERRORS . IN THE FOLLOWING TWO OF THESE HEURISTICS ( AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC AND REPRESENTATIVENESS HEURISTIC ) ARE EXPLAINED . SUBSEQUENTLY THE CONFIRMATION BIAS IS INTRODUCED WHICH SOMETIMES INFLUENCES PEOPLE S REASONS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN OPINION WITHOUT THEM REALISING IT</pattern>
<template>In a process of inductive reasoning people often make use of certain heuristics which lead in many cases quickly to adequate conclusions but sometimes may cause errors. In the following, two of these heuristics (availability heuristic and representativeness heuristic) are explained. Subsequently, the confirmation bias is introduced which sometimes influences people's reasons according to their own opinion without them realising it.</template>

<pattern>CONCLUSIONS REACHED THROUGH A PROCESS OF INDUCTIVE REASONING ARE NEVER DEFINITELY TRUE AS NO ONE HAS SEEN ALL CROWS ON EARTH AND AS IT IS POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH VERY UNLIKELY THAT THERE IS A GREEN OR BROWN EXEMPLAR .

SO THE STRONGER THESE FACTORS ARE THE MORE RELIABLE ARE THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED THROUGH INDUCTION</pattern>
<template>Conclusions reached through a process of inductive reasoning are never definitely true as no one has seen all crows on earth and as it is possible, although very unlikely, that there is a green or brown exemplar.

<pattern>WHEN KNUT AND HIS WIFE OBSERVE IN ADDITION TO THE BLACK CROWS IN GERMANY ALSO THE CROWS IN SPAIN THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS THEY MAKE CONCERNING THE CROWS OBVIOUSLY INCREASES . FURTHERMORE THE REPRESENTATIVENESS OF THESE OBSERVATIONS IS SUPPORTED IF KNUT AND HIS WIFE OBSERVE THE CROWS AT ALL DIFFERENT DAY- AND NIGHTTIMES AND SEE THAT THEY ARE BLACK EVERY TIME . THEORETICALLY IT MAY BE THAT THE CROWS CHANGE THEIR COLOUR AT NIGHT WHAT WOULD MAKE THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL CROWS ARE BLACK WRONG . THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR ALL CROWS TO BE BLACK INCREASES IF KNUT AND HIS WIFE ADD SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENTS WHICH SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION . FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD FIND OUT THAT THE CROWS GENES DETERMINE THAT THE ONLY COLOUR THEY CAN HAVE IS BLACK</pattern>
<template>When Knut and his wife observe in addition to the black crows in Germany also the crows in Spain, the number of observations they make concerning the crows obviously increases. Furthermore, the representativeness of these observations is supported, if Knut and his wife observe the crows at all different day- and nighttimes and see that they are black every time. Theoretically it may be that the crows change their colour at night what would make the conclusion that all crows are black wrong. The quality of the evidence for all crows to be black increases, if Knut and his wife add scientific measurements which support the conclusion. For example they could find out that the crows' genes determine that the only colour they can have is black.</template>

<pattern>TO SUM IT UP STRONG INDUCTIVE REASONING GETS TO CONCLUSIONS WHICH ARE VERY PROBABLE WHEREAS THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED THROUGH WEAK INDUCTIVE REASONING ON THE BASE OF THE PREMISES ARE UNLIKELY TO BE TRUE</pattern>
<template>To sum it up, strong inductive reasoning gets to conclusions which are very probable whereas the conclusions reached through weak inductive reasoning on the base of the premises are unlikely to be true.</template>

<pattern>IN THIS INSTANCE THE CONCLUSION IS OBVIOUSLY FALSE . THE INFORMATION THE PREMISE CONTAINS IS NOT VERY REPRESENTATIVE AND ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE IT DOES NOT GIVE DECISIVE EVIDENCE FOR THE TRUTH OF THE CONCLUSION</pattern>
<template>In this instance the conclusion is obviously false. The information the premise contains is not very representative and although it is true, it does not give decisive evidence for the truth of the conclusion.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE TWO DIFFERENT FORMS OF INDUCTIVE REASONING ARE STRONG AND WEAK INDUCTION . THE FORMER DESCRIBES THAT THE TRUTH OF THE CONCLUSION IS VERY LIKELY IF THE ASSUMED PREMISES ARE TRUE . AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS FORM OF REASONING IS THE ONE GIVEN IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION . IN THIS CASE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE PREMISE ( ALL CROWS KNUT AND HIS WIFE HAVE EVER SEEN ARE BLACK ) GIVES GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THE CONCLUSION ( ALL CROWS ON EARTH ARE BLACK ) TO BE TRUE . BUT NEVERTHELESS IT IS STILL POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH VERY UNLIKELY THAT NOT ALL CROWS ARE BLACK</pattern>
<template>The two different forms of inductive reasoning are "strong" and "weak" induction.
The former describes that the truth of the conclusion is very likely, if the assumed premises are true. An example for this form of reasoning is the one given in the previous section. In this case it is obvious that the premise ("All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are black") gives good evidence for the conclusion ("All crows on earth are black") to be true. But nevertheless it is still possible, although very unlikely, that not all crows are black.</template>

<category>
<pattern>IN THIS EXAMPLE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT KNUT AND HIS WIFE INFER FROM THE SIMPLE OBSERVATION ABOUT THE CROWS THEY HAVE SEEN TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE ABOUT ALL CROWS . CONSIDERING FIGURE 5 THIS MEANS THAT THEY INFER FROM THE SUBSET ( YELLOW CIRCLE ) TO THE WHOLE ( BLUE CIRCLE ) . AS IN THIS EXAMPLE IT IS TYPICAL IN A PROCESS OF INDUCTIVE REASONING THAT THE PREMISES ARE BELIEVED TO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION BUT DO NOT ENSURE IT</pattern>
<template>In this example it is obvious that Knut and his wife infer from the simple observation about the crows they have seen to the general principle about all crows.

<pattern>AFFIRMING THE CONSEQUENT IN THE CASE OF THE GIVEN EXAMPLE MEANS THAT THE SECOND PREMISE SAYS THAT KNUT S WIFE GETS WET . BUT AGAIN THE REASON FOR THIS CAN BE CIRCUMSTANCES APART FROM RAIN . SO IT FOLLOWS NOT LOGICALLY THAT IT IS RAINING . IN CONSEQUENCE THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SYLLOGISM IS INVALID</pattern>
<template>Affirming the consequent in the case of the given example means that the second premise says that Knut`s wife gets wet. But again the reason for this can be circumstances apart from rain. So, it follows not logically that it is raining. In consequence, the conclusion of this syllogism is invalid.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING TWO KINDS OF CONDITIONAL SYLLOGISMS IS JUDGED CORRECTLY ONLY BY 40 % OF PEOPLE . IF THE METHOD OF DENYING THE ANTECEDENT IS APPLIED THE SECOND PREMISE SAYS THAT IT IS NOT RAINING . BUT FROM THIS FACT IT FOLLOWS NOT LOGICALLY THAT KNUT S WIFE DOES NOT GET WET – OBVIOUSLY RAIN IS NOT THE ONLY REASON FOR HER TO GET WET . IT COULD ALSO BE THE CASE THAT THE SUN IS SHINING AND KNUT TESTS HIS NEW WATER PISTOL AND MAKES HER WET . SO THIS KIND OF CONDITIONAL SYLLOGISM DOES NOT LEAD TO A VALID CONCLUSION</pattern>
<template>The validity of the remaining two kinds of conditional syllogisms is judged correctly only by 40% of people. If the method of denying the antecedent is applied, the second premise says that it is not raining. But from this fact it follows not logically that Knut`s wife does not get wet – obviously rain is not the only reason for her to get wet. It could also be the case that the sun is shining and Knut tests his new water pistol and makes her wet. So, this kind of conditional syllogism does not lead to a valid conclusion.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE VALIDITY OF THE MODUS TOLLENS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE . REFERRING TO THE EXAMPLE IN THE CASE THAT KNUT S WIFE DOES NOT GET WET IT CAN T BE RAINING . BECAUSE THE FIRST PREMISE SAYS THAT IF IT IS RAINING SHE GETS WET . SO THE REASON FOR KNUT S WIFE NOT GETTING WET IS THAT IT IS NOT RAINING . CONSEQUENTLY THE CONCLUSION IS VALID</pattern>
<template>The validity of the modus tollens is more difficult to recognize. Referring to the example, in the case that Knut`s wife does not get wet it can`t be raining. Because the first premise says that if it is raining, she gets wet. So the reason for Knut`s wife not getting wet is that it is not raining. Consequently, the conclusion is valid.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>OBVIOUSLY THE VALIDITY OF THE SYLLOGISMS WITH VALID CONCLUSIONS IS EASIER TO JUDGE IN A CORRECT MANNER THAN THE VALIDITY OF THE ONES WITH INVALID CONCLUSIONS . THE CONCLUSION IN THE INSTANCE OF THE MODUS PONENS IS APPARENTLY VALID . IN THE EXAMPLE IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT KNUT S WIFE GETS WET IF IT IS RAINING</pattern>
<template>Obviously, the validity of the syllogisms with valid conclusions is easier to judge in a correct manner than the validity of the ones with invalid conclusions. The conclusion in the instance of the modus ponens is apparently valid. In the example it is very clear that Knut`s wife gets wet, if it is raining.</template>

<template>People can be influenced by the content of syllogisms rather than by focusing on logic when judging their validity. Psychologists have wondered whether people are influenced by their cultures when judging. Therefore they have done cross–cultural experiments in which reasoning problems were presented to people of different cultures. They observed that people from different cultures judge differently to these problems. People use evidence from their own experience (empirical evidence) and ignore evidence presented in the syllogism (theoretical evidence).</template>

<pattern>WHILE USING THE METHOD OF EVALUATION RESEARCHERS FOUND TYPICAL MISJUDGMENTS ABOUT SYLLOGISMS . PREMISES STARTING WITH “ ALL ” “ SOME ” OR “ NO ” IMPLY A SPECIAL ATMOSPHERE AND INFLUENCE A PERSON IN THE PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING . ONE MISTAKE OFTEN OCCURRING IS JUDGING A SYLLOGISM INCORRECTLY AS VALID IN WHICH THE TWO PREMISES AS WELL AS THE CONCLUSION STARTS WITH “ ALL ” . THE INFLUENCE OF THE PROVIDED ATMOSPHERE LEADS TO THE RIGHT DECISION AT MOST TIMES BUT IS DEFINITELY NOT RELIABLE AND GUIDES THE PERSON TO A RASH DECISION . THIS PHENOMENON IS CALLED THE ATMOSPHERE EFFECT</pattern>
<template>While using the method of evaluation researchers found typical misjudgments about syllogisms. Premises starting with “All”, “Some” or “No” imply a special atmosphere and influence a person in the process of decision making. One mistake often occurring is judging a syllogism incorrectly as valid, in which the two premises as well as the conclusion starts with “All”. The influence of the provided atmosphere leads to the right decision at most times, but is definitely not reliable and guides the person to a rash decision. This phenomenon is called the atmosphere effect.</template>

<pattern>DUE TO THIS PRECONDITION IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISPLAY A SYLLOGISM FORMALLY WITH SYMBOLS OR LETTERS AND EXPLAIN ITS RELATIONSHIP GRAPHICALLY WITH THE HELP OF DIAGRAMS . THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS TO DEMONSTRATE A PREMISE GRAPHICALLY . STARTING WITH A CIRCLE TO REPRESENT THE FIRST PREMISE AND ADDING ONE OR MORE CIRCLES FOR THE SECOND ONE ( FIGURE 1 ) THE CRUCIAL MOVE IS TO COMPARE THE CONSTRUCTED DIAGRAMS WITH THE CONCLUSION . IT SHOULD BE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHETHER THE DIAGRAMS ARE CONTRADICTORY OR NOT . AGREEING WITH ONE ANOTHER THE SYLLOGISM IS VALID . THE DISPLAYED SYLLOGISM ( FIGURE 1 ) IS OBVIOUSLY VALID . THE CONCLUSION SHOWS THAT EVERYTHING THAT CAN JUMP CONTAINS ANIMALS WHICH AGAIN CONTAINS FLOWERS . THIS AGREES WITH THE TWO PREMISES WHICH POINT OUT THAT FLOWERS ARE ANIMALS AND THAT THESE ARE ABLE TO JUMP . THE METHOD OF EULER CIRCLES IS A GOOD DEVICE TO MAKE SYLLOGISMS BETTER CONCEIVABLE</pattern>
<template>Due to this precondition it is possible to display a syllogism formally with symbols or letters and explain its relationship graphically with the help of diagrams. There are various ways to demonstrate a premise graphically. Starting with a circle to represent the first premise and adding one or more circles for the second one (Figure 1), the crucial move is to compare the constructed diagrams with the conclusion. It should be clearly laid out whether the diagrams are contradictory or not. Agreeing with one another, the syllogism is valid.
The displayed syllogism (Figure 1) is obviously valid. The conclusion shows that everything that can jump contains animals which again contains flowers. This agrees with the two premises which point out that flowers are animals and that these are able to jump. The method of Euler Circles is a good device to make syllogisms better conceivable.</template>

<pattern>IN CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISMS THE STATEMENTS OF THE PREMISES BEGIN TYPICALLY WITH “ ALL ” “ NONE ” OR “ SOME ” AND THE CONCLUSION STARTS WITH “ THEREFORE ” OR “ HENCE ” .

IN THE EXAMPLE GIVEN ABOVE IN THE INTRODUCTION OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING THESE CATEGORIES ARE SPAIN AND THE NEED FOR SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS . TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES SERVE THE STUDY OF CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISMS WHICH ARE THE NORMATIVE APPROACH AND THE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH</pattern>
<template>In categorical syllogisms the statements of the premises begin typically with “all”, “none” or “some” and the conclusion starts with “therefore” or “hence”. These kinds of syllogisms fulfill the task of describing a relationship between two categories. In the example given above in the introduction of deductive reasoning these categories are Spain and the need for shorts and T-Shirts. Two different approaches serve the study of categorical syllogisms which are the normative approach and the descriptive approach.</template>

<pattern>ALTHOUGH THE TWO HEMISPHERES LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER ’ S MIRROR IMAGES AT FIRST GLANCE THIS IMPRESSION IS MISLEADING . TAKING A CLOSER LOOK THE HEMISPHERES NOT ONLY DIFFER IN THEIR CONFORMATION AND CHEMISTRY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THEIR FUNCTION . ALTHOUGH BOTH HEMISPHERES CAN PERFORM ALL BASIC COGNITIVE TASKS THERE EXISTS A SPECIALISATION FOR SPECIFIC COGNITIVE DEMANDS . IN MOST PEOPLE THE LEFT HEMISPHERE IS AN EXPERT AT VERBAL TASKS WHEREAS THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE HAS SUPERIOR ABILITIES IN NON-VERBAL TASKS . DESPITE THE FUNCTIONAL DISTINCTNESS THE HEMISPHERES COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER VIA THE CORPUS CALLOSUM</pattern>
<template>Although the two hemispheres look like each other’s mirror images at first glance, this impression is 
misleading. Taking a closer look, the hemispheres not only differ in their conformation and chemistry, but 
most importantly in their function. Although both hemispheres can perform all basic cognitive tasks, 
there exists a specialisation for specific cognitive demands. In most people, the left hemisphere is an 
expert at verbal tasks, whereas the right hemisphere has superior abilities in non-verbal tasks. 
Despite the functional distinctness the hemispheres communicate with each other via the corpus 
callosum.</template>

<pattern>ONE BRAIN AREA FOR WHICH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GENDERS WAS OBSERVED IS THE CORPUS CALLOSUM . ALTHOUGH ONE STUDY FOUND THAT THE C.C . IS LARGER IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN THESE RESULTS COULD NOT BE REPLICATED . INSTEAD IT WAS FOUND THAT THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE C.C . IS MORE BULBOUS IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN . THIS MIGHT HOWEVER BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE WOMAN HAS A SMALLER BRAIN THAN THE AVERAGE MAN AND THUS THE BULBOUSNESS OF THE POSTERIOR SECTION OF THE C.C . MIGHT BE RELATED TO BRAIN SIZE AND NOT TO GENDER</pattern>
<template>One brain area for which a difference between the genders was observed is the corpus callosum. 
Although one study found that the c.c. is larger in women than in men these results could not be 
replicated. Instead it was found that the posterior part of the c.c. is more bulbous in women than in 
men. This might however be related to the fact that the average woman has a smaller brain than the 
average man and thus the bulbousness of the posterior section of the c.c. might be related to brain size 
and not to gender.</template>

<pattern>GENDER IS ALSO AN ASPECT THAT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE IMPACT ON THE HEMISPHERIC SPECIALISATION .

IN HUMANS IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE TO WHICH EXTENT IT IS REALLY HORMONES THAT CAUSE DIFFERENCES AND TO WHICH EXTENT IT IS CULTURE AND SCHOOLING THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE</pattern>
<template>Gender is also an aspect that is believed to have impact on the hemispheric specialisation.  In 
animal studies, it was found that hormones create brain differences between the genders that are 
related to reproductional functions. In humans it is hard to determine to which extent it is really 
hormones that cause differences and to which extent it is culture and schooling that are responsible.</template>

<pattern>HANDEDNESS IS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE BRAIN LATERALISATION . THERE IS STATISTICAL EVIDENCE THAT LEFT-HANDERS HAVE A DIFFERENT BRAIN ORGANISATION THAN RIGHT-HANDERS . 10 % OF THE POPULATION IS LEFT-HANDED . WHEREAS 95 % OF THE RIGHT-HANDED PEOPLE PROCESS VERBAL MATERIAL IN A SUPERIOR MANNER IN THE LEFT-HEMISPHERE THERE IS NO SUCH A HIGH FIGURE FOR VERBAL SUPERIORITY OF ONE HEMISPHERE IN LEFT-HANDERS : 70 % OF THE LEFT-HANDERS PROCESS VERBAL MATERIAL IN THE LEFT-HEMISPHERE 15 % PROCESS VERBAL MATERIAL IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE ( THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HEMISPHERES ARE SIMPLY SWITCHED AROUND ) AND THE REMAINING 15 % ARE NOT LATERALISED MEANING THAT THEY PROCESS LANGUAGE IN BOTH HEMISPHERES . THUS AS A GROUP LEFT-HANDERS SEEM TO BE LESS LATERALISED . HOWEVER A SINGLE LEFT-HANDED-INDIVIDUAL CAN BE JUST AS LATERALISED AS THE AVERAGE RIGHT-HANDER</pattern>
<template>Handedness is another factor that might influence brain lateralisation. There is statistical evidence 
that left-handers have a different brain organisation than right-handers. 10% of the population is left-handed. Whereas 95% of the right-handed people process verbal material in a superior manner in the 
left-hemisphere, there is no such a high figure for verbal superiority of one hemisphere in left-handers: 
70% of the left-handers process verbal material in the left-hemisphere, 15% process verbal material in 
the right hemisphere (the functions of the hemispheres are simply switched around), and the 
remaining 15% are not lateralised, meaning that they process language in both hemispheres. 
Thus as a group, left-handers seem to be less lateralised. However a single left-handed-individual can 
be just as lateralised as the average right-hander.</template>

<template>Although children who underwent hemispherectomy (the surgical removal of one hemisphere) do 
develop the cognitive skills of the missing hemisphere (in contrast to adults or adolescents who can 
only partly compensate for missing brain parts), they do not develop these skills to the same extent as 
a child with hemispherectomy of the other hemisphere. For example: A child whose right hemisphere 
has been removed will develop spatial skills but not to the extent that a  child whose left hemisphere 
has been removed, and thus still possesses the right hemisphere.</template>

<pattern>THE THIRD MOST SURPRISING WAY THE HEMISPHERES CAN INTERACT IS THAT WHEN PERFORMING A TASK TOGETHER THE HEMISPHERES BEHAVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN PERFORMING THE SAME TASK INDIVIDUALLY .

<template>The third, most surprising way the hemispheres can interact is that when performing a task together 
the hemispheres behave totally different than when performing the same task individually. This can be 
compared to social behavior of people: Individuals behave different in groups than they would when

<pattern>ANOTHER WAY OF HOW THE HEMISPHERES INTERACT IS THAT OVERALL PROCESSING IS AN AVERAGE OF PERFORMANCE OF THE TWO INDIVIDUAL HEMISPHERES</pattern>

<category>
<pattern>THE TWO HEMISPHERES CAN INTERACT OVER THE CORPUS CALLOSUM IN DIFFERENT WAYS . THIS IS MEASURED BY FIRST COMPUTING PERFORMANCE OF EACH HEMISPHERE INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN MEASURING THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE WHOLE BRAIN . IN SOME TASKS ONE HEMISPHERE MAY DOMINATE THE OTHER IN THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE SO THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE IS AS GOOD OR BAD AS THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THE SINGLE HEMISPHERES . WHAT IS SURPRISING IS THAT THE DOMINATING HEMISPHERE MAY VERY WELL BE THE ONE THAT IS LESS SPECIALISED SO HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A SITUATION WHERE PARALLEL PROCESSING IS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN PROCESSING IN JUST ONE HALF OF THE BRAIN</pattern>
<template>The two hemispheres can interact over the corpus callosum in different ways. This is measured by first 
computing performance of each hemisphere individually and then measuring the overall performance of 
the whole brain. In some tasks one hemisphere may dominate the other in the overall performance, so 
the overall performance is as good or bad as the performance of one of the single hemispheres. What's 
surprising is that the dominating hemisphere may very well be the one that is less specialised, so here 
is another example of a situation where parallel processing is less effective than processing in just one 
half of the brain.</template>

FOR PATIENTS WITH LEFT-HEMISPHERE-DAMAGE THIS IS TRUE THE OTHER WAY AROUND . THIS EXPERIMENT SUPPORTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE HEMISPHERES DIFFER IN THE WAY THEY PROCESS INFORMATION</pattern>
<template>The picture above shows an exemplary response to different target stimuli in an experiment on global 
and local processing with patients who suffer right- or left-hemisphere damage. Patients with damage 
to the right hemisphere often suffer a lack of attention to the global form, but recognise details with no 
problem. For patients with left-hemisphere-damage this is true the other way around. 
This experiment supports the assumption that the hemispheres differ in the way they process information.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE OTHER APPROACH DOES NOT FOCUS ON WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IS PROCESSED BY EACH HEMISPHERE BUT RATHER ON HOW EACH HEMISPHERE PROCESSES INFORMATION . THIS SET OF THEORIES ASSUMES THAT THE LEFT HEMISPHERE PROCESSES INFORMATION IN AN ANALYTIC DETAIL- AND FUNCTION-FOCUSED WAY AND THAT IT PLACES MORE IMPORTANCE ON TEMPORAL RELATIONS BETWEEN INFORMATION WHEREAS THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE IS BELIEVED TO GO ABOUT THE PROCESSING OF INFORMATION IN A HOLISTIC WAY FOCUSING ON SPATIAL RELATIONS AND ON APPEARANCE RATHER THAN ON FUNCTION</pattern>
<template>The other approach does not focus on what type of information is processed by each hemisphere but 
rather on how each hemisphere processes information. This set of theories assumes that the left 
hemisphere processes information in an analytic, detail- and function-focused way and that it places 
more importance on temporal relations between information, whereas the right hemisphere is believed  
to go about the processing of information in a holistic way, focusing on spatial relations and on 
appearance rather than on function.</template>

<category>
<pattern>THERE ARE TWO SETS OF APPROACHES TO THE QUESTION OF HEMISPHERIC SPECIALISATION . ONE SET OF THEORIES IS ABOUT THE TOPIC BY ASKING THE QUESTION “ WHAT TASKS IS EACH HEMISPHERE SPECIALISED FOR ? ” . THEORIES THAT BELONG TO THIS SET ASSIGN THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABILITY TO PROCESS SENSORY INFORMATION TO THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABILITIES FOR HIGHER COGNITIVE SKILLS . ONE THEORY THAT BELONGS TO THIS SET IS THE “ SPATIAL FREQUENCY HYPOTHESIS ” . THIS HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT THE LEFT HEMISPHERE IS IMPORTANT FOR FINE DETAIL ANALYSIS AND HIGH SPATIAL FREQUENCY IN VISUAL IMAGES WHEREAS THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE IS IMPORTANT FOR LOW SPATIAL FREQUENCY . WE HAVE PURSUED THIS APPROACH ABOVE</pattern>
<template>There are two sets of approaches to the question of hemispheric specialisation. One set of 
theories is about the topic by asking the question “What tasks is each hemisphere specialised for?”. 
Theories that belong to this set, assign the different levels of ability to process sensory information to 
the different levels of abilities for higher cognitive skills.  One theory that belongs to this set is the 
“spatial frequency hypothesis”.  This hypothesis states that the left hemisphere is important for fine 
detail analysis and high spatial frequency in visual images whereas the right hemisphere is important 
for low spatial frequency. 
We have pursued this approach above.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ALTHOUGH THE HEMISPHERES ARE SO DISTINCT AND ARE EXPERTS AT THEIR ASSIGNED FUNCTIONS THEY ALSO HAVE LIMITED ABILITIES IN PERFORMING THE TASKS FOR WHICH THE OTHER HEMISPHERE IS SPECIALISED . IN THE PICTURE ABOVE IS AN OVERVIEW WHICH HEMISPHERE GIVES RAISE TO WHAT ABILITY</pattern>
<template>Although the hemispheres are so distinct and  are experts at their assigned functions, they also have 
limited abilities in performing the tasks for which the other hemisphere is specialised. In the picture 
above is an overview which hemisphere gives raise to what ability.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ALL THE EXPERIMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE HAVE SOME BASIC FINDINGS IN COMMON : THE LEFT HEMISPHERE IS SUPERIOR AT VERBAL TASKS SUCH AS THE PROCESSING OF SPEECH SPEECH PRODUCTION AND RECOGNITION OF LETTERS WHEREAS THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE EXCELS AT NON-VERBAL TASKS SUCH AS FACE RECOGNITION OR TASKS THAT INVOLVE SPATIAL SKILLS SUCH AS LINE ORIENTATION OR DISTINGUISHING DIFFERENT PITCHES OF SOUND . THIS IS EVIDENCE AGAINST THE CEREBRAL DOMINANCE THEORY WHICH APPOINTED THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE TO BE A SPARE TIRE ! IN FACT BOTH HEMISPHERES ARE DISTINCT AND OUTCLASS AT DIFFERENT TASKS AND NEITHER ONE CAN BE OMITTED WITHOUT THIS HAVING HIGH IMPACT ON COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE</pattern>
<template>All the experiments mentioned above have some basic findings in common: The left hemisphere is superior at verbal tasks 
such as the processing of speech, speech production and recognition of letters whereas the right 
hemisphere excels at non-verbal tasks such as face recognition or tasks that involve spatial skills such 
as line orientation, or distinguishing different pitches of sound. This is evidence against the cerebral 
dominance theory which appointed the right hemisphere to be a spare tire! In fact both hemispheres 
are distinct and outclass at different tasks, and neither one can be omitted without this having high 
impact on cognitive performance.</template>

<pattern>THE DICHOTIC PRESENTATION TECHNIQUE ENABLES RESEARCHERS TO STUDY THE PROCESSING OF AUDITORY INFORMATION . HERE DIFFERENT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO EACH EAR .

<pattern>THE DIVIDED VISUAL FIELD TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE VISUAL FIELD CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THE RIGHT ( RVF ) AND LEFT VISUAL FIELD ( LVF ) .

THE DIVIDED VISUAL FIELD TECHNIQUE INCLUDES TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS : THE EXPERIMENTER CAN PRESENT ONE PICTURE IN JUST ONE OF THE VISUAL FIELDS AND THEN LET THE SUBJECT RESPOND TO THIS STIMULUS . THE OTHER POSSIBILITY INVOLVES SHOWING TWO DIFFERENT PICTURES IN EACH VISUAL FIELD</pattern>
<template>The divided visual field technique is based on the fact that the visual field can be divided into the right 
(RVF) and left visual field (LVF). Each visual field is processed independently from the other in the

<template>Research with people who suffer brain lesions or even have a commissurotomy has some major draw 
backs: The reason why they had to undergo such surgery is usually epileptic seizures. Because of this, 
it is possible that their brains are not typical or have received damage to other areas during the 
surgery. Also, these studies have been performed with very limited numbers of subjects, so the 
statistical reliability might not be high.</template>

<pattern>THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED TO GAIN MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HEMISPHERIC SPECIALISATION . THEY WERE CONDUCTED WITH EPILEPTIC INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ABOUT TO RECEIVE SURGERY WHERE PARTS OF ONE OF THEIR HEMISPHERES WAS GOING TO BE REMOVED . BEFORE THE SURGERY STARTED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT WHICH HEMISPHERE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SPEECH IN THIS INDIVIDUAL . THIS WAS DONE USING THE WADA-TECHNIQUE WHERE BARBITURATE IS INJECTED INTO ONE OF THE ARTERIES SUPPLYING THE BRAIN WITH BLOOD . SHORTLY AFTER THE INJECTION THE CONTRA-LATERAL SIDE OF THE BODY IS PARALYSED . IF THE PERSON IS NOW STILL ABLE TO SPEAK THE DOPED HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SPEECH PRODUCTION IN THIS INDIVIDUAL . WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS TECHNIQUE IT COULD BE ESTIMATED THAT 95 \ % OF ALL ADULT RIGHT-HANDERS USE THEIR LEFT HEMISPHERE FOR SPEECH</pattern>
<template>There have been other experiments conducted to gain more knowledge about hemispheric specialisation. They were
conducted with epileptic individuals who were about to receive surgery where parts of one of their 
hemispheres was going to be removed. Before the surgery started it was important to find out which 
hemisphere is responsible for speech in this individual. This was done using the Wada-technique, 
where barbiturate is injected into one of the arteries supplying the brain with blood. Shortly after the 
injection, the contra-lateral side of the body is paralysed. If the person is now still able to speak, the 
doped hemisphere of the brain is not responsible for speech production in this individual. With the 
results of this technique it could be estimated that 95\% of all adult right-handers use their left 
hemisphere for speech.</template>

<pattern>SPERRY USED DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IN HIS STUDIES BUT THE BASIC ASSUMPTION BEHIND ALL EXPERIMENTS OF THIS TYPE WAS THAT PERCEPTUAL INFORMATION RECEIVED AT ONE SIDE OF THE BODY IS PROCESSED IN THE CONTRA-LATERAL HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN . IN ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS THE SUBJECTS HAD TO RECOGNISE OBJECTS BY TOUCHING IT WITH MERELY ONE HAND WHILE BEING BLINDFOLDED . HE THEN ASKED THE PATIENTS TO NAME THE OBJECT THEY FELT AND FOUND THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT NAME IT WHEN TOUCHING IT WITH THE LEFT HAND ( WHICH IS LINKED TO THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE ) . THE QUESTION THAT AROSE WAS WHETHER THIS INABILITY WAS DUE TO A POSSIBLE FUNCTION OF THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE AS “ SPARE TIRE ” OR DUE TO SOMETHING ELSE . SPERRY NOW CHANGED THE DESIGN OF HIS EXPERIMENT SO THAT PATIENTS NOW HAD TO SHOW THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE OBJECTS BY USING IT THE RIGHT WAY . FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY RECOGNISED A PENCIL THEY WOULD USE IT TO WRITE . WITH THIS CHANGED DESIGN NO DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE BETWEEN BOTH HANDS WERE FOUND</pattern>
<template>Sperry used different experimental designs in his studies, but the basic assumption behind all 
experiments of this type was that perceptual information received at one side of the body is processed 
in the contra-lateral hemisphere of the brain. In one of the experiments the subjects had to recognise 
objects by touching it with merely one hand, while being blindfolded. He then asked the patients to 
name the object they felt and found that people could not name it when touching it with the left hand 
(which is linked to the right hemisphere). The question that arose was whether this inability was due to 
a possible function of the right hemisphere as “spare tire” or due to something else. Sperry now 
changed the design of his experiment so that patients now had to show that they recognised the 
objects  by using it the right way. For example, if they recognised a pencil they would use it to write. 
With this changed design, no difference in performance between both hands were found.</template>

<template>Sperry’s experiments took place with people who suffered a condition called “split brain syndrome” 
because they underwent a commissurotomy. In a commissurotomy the corpus callosum is

<pattern>BECAUSE IN THESE DAYS LANGUAGE WAS SEEN AS THE COGNITIVE PROCESS SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER PROCESSES THE LEFT HEMISPHERE WAS BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE RIGHT WHICH WAS EXPRESSED IN THE “ CEREBRAL DOMINANCE THEORY ” DEVELOPED BY J.H .

IN THIS DECADE AND THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THIS PICTURE .

<template>Because in these days language was seen as the cognitive process superior to all other processes, the 
left hemisphere was believed to be superior to the right which was expressed in the “cerebral 
dominance theory” developed by J.H. Jackson. The right hemisphere was seen as a “spare tire [...] 
having few functions of its own” (Banich, S.94). 
This view was not challenged until the 1930s. In this decade and the following, research dramatically 
changed this picture. Of special importance for showing the role of the right hemisphere was Sperry, 
who conducted several experiments in 1974 for which he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and

<template>Concerning the anatomy, some areas are larger and the tissue contains more dendritic spines in one 
hemisphere than in the other.  An example of this is what used to be called “Broca’s area” in the left 
hemisphere. This area which is –among other things- important for speech production shows greater 
branching in the left hemisphere than in the respective right hemisphere area. Because of the left 
hemisphere’s importance for language, with which we will deal later, one can conclude that anatomical

<template>Computational knowledge representation is mostly not used as a model of cognition but to make pools of information accessible, i.e. as an extension of database technology. In these cases general rules and models are not needed. With growing storage media, one is capable of creating simple knowledge bases stating all specific facts. The information is stored in the form of sentential knowledge, that is knowledge saved in form of sentences comparable to propositions and program code. Knowledge is seen as a reservoir of useful information rather than as supporting a model of cognitive activity. More recently, increased available memory size has made it feasible to use "compute-intensive" representations that simply list all the particular facts rather than stating general rules. These allow the use of statistical techniques such as Markov simulation, but seem to abandon any claim to psychological plausibility.</template>

Most formalisms have the following attributes to be able to express information more clearly: The Semantic Network Approach, hierarchies of concepts (e.g. vehicle -> car -> truck) and property inheritance (e.g. red cars have four wheels since cars have four wheels). There are attributes that provide the possibility to add new information to the system without creating any inconsistencies, and the possibility to create a "closed-world" assumption. For example if the information that we have gravitation on earth is omitted, the closed-world assumption must be false for our earth/world.</template>

<template>One possible alternative to the Propositional Approach, is the Imagery Approach. Since here the representation of knowledge is understood as the 
storage of images as we see them, it is also called analogical or perceptual approach. In contrast to the Propositional Approach it works with non-discrete 
symbols and is modality specific. It is an implicit approach to mental representation. The picture of the sports car includes implicitly seats of any 
kind. If additionally mentioned that they are off-white, the image changes 
to a more specific one. How two non-discrete symbols are combined is not 
as predetermined as it is for discrete symbols. The picture of the off-white 
seats may exist without the red car around, as well as the red car did before 
without the off-white seats.

IT IS ASSUMED THAT RAPID LEARNING TAKES PLACE IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND THAT CONCEPTUAL AND GRADUAL LEARNING IS LOCATED IN THE CORTEX</pattern>
<template>On the other hand, the connectionist approach is not without problems. Formerly 
learned concepts can be superposed by new concepts. In addition, PDP can 
not explain more complex processes than learning concepts. Neither can it 
explain the phenomenon of rapid learning, which does not require extensive 
learning. It is assumed that rapid learning takes place in the hippocampus, 
and that conceptual and gradual learning is located in the cortex.</template>

<pattern>THE PDP APPROACH IS IMPORTANT FOR KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION STUDIES . IT IS FAR FROM PERFECT BUT ON THE MOVE TO GET THERE . THE PROCESS OF LEARNING ENABLES THE SYSTEM TO MAKE GENERALIZATIONS BECAUSE SIMILAR CONCEPTS CREATE SIMILAR PATTERNS . AFTER KNOWING ONE CAR THE SYSTEM CAN RECOGNIZE SIMILAR PATTERNS AS OTHER CARS OR MAY EVEN PREDICT HOW OTHER CARS LOOK LIKE . FURTHERMORE THE SYSTEM IS PROTECTED AGAINST TOTAL WRECKAGE . A DAMAGE TO SINGLE UNITS WILL NOT CAUSE THE SYSTEM ’ S TOTAL BREAKDOWN BUT WILL DELETE ONLY SOME PATTERNS WHICH USE THOSE UNITS . THIS IS CALLED GRACEFUL DEGRADATION AND IS OFTEN FOUND IN PATIENTS WITH BRAIN LESIONS . THESE TWO ARGUMENTS LEAD TO THE THIRD . THE PDP IS ORGANIZED SIMILARLY TO THE HUMAN BRAIN . AND SOME EFFECTIVE COMPUTER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED ON THIS BASIS THAT WERE ABLE TO PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN BRAIN DAMAGE</pattern>
<template>The PDP approach is important for knowledge representation studies. It is far from perfect, but 
on the move to get there.  The process of learning enables the system to make generalizations, because similar concepts create 
similar patterns. After knowing one car, the system can recognize similar 
patterns as other cars, or may even predict how other cars look like. Furthermore, the system is protected against total wreckage. A damage to single 
units will not cause the system’s total breakdown, but will delete only some 
patterns, which use those units. This is called graceful degradation and is 
often found in patients with brain lesions. These two arguments lead to the 
third. The PDP is organized similarly to the human brain. And some effective computer programs have been developed on this basis, that were able 
to predict the consequences of human brain damage.</template>

<pattern>FIRST A STIMULUS IS PRESENTED TO THE INPUT UNITS . THEN THE LINKS PASS ON THE SIGNAL TO THE HIDDEN UNITS THAT DISTRIBUTE THE SIGNAL TO THE OUTPUT UNITS VIA FURTHER LINKS . IN THE FIRST TRIAL THE OUTPUT UNITS SHOWS A WRONG PATTERN . AFTER MANY REPETITIONS THE PATTERN FINALLY IS CORRECT . THIS IS ACHIEVED BY BACK PROPAGATION . THE ERROR SIGNALS ARE SEND BACK TO THE HIDDEN UNITS AND THE SIGNALS ARE REPROCESSED . DURING THESE REPETITIVE TRIALS THE ” WEIGHTS ” OF THE SIGNAL ARE GRADUALLY CALIBRATED ON BEHALF OF THE ERROR SIGNALS IN ORDER TO GET A RIGHT OUTPUT PATTERN AT LAST . AFTER HAVING ACHIEVED A CORRECT PATTERN FOR ONE STIMULUS THE SYSTEM IS READY TO LEARN A NEW CONCEPT</pattern>
<template>First a stimulus is presented to the input units. 
Then the links pass on the signal to the hidden units, that distribute the 
signal to the output units via further links. 
In the first trial, the output units shows a wrong pattern. After many repetitions, the pattern finally is 
correct. This is achieved by back propagation. The error signals are send back 
to the hidden units and the signals are reprocessed. During these repetitive 
trials, the ”weights” of the signal are gradually calibrated on behalf of the 
error signals in order to get a right output pattern at last. 
After having achieved a correct pattern for one stimulus, the system is ready 
to learn a new concept.</template>

<pattern>IT NEEDS TO BE EMPHASIZED THAT CONNECTIONIST NETWORKS ARE NOT MODELS OF HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS . THE APPROACH OF CONNECTIONIST NETWORKS IS A HYPOTHETICAL APPROACH TO REPRESENT CATEGORIES IN NETWORK PATTERNS . ANOTHER NAME FOR THE CONNECTIONIST APPROACH IS PARALLEL DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING APPROACH FOR SHORT PDP SINCE PROCESSING TAKES PLACE IN PARALLEL LINES AND THE OUTPUT IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS MANY UNITS</pattern>
<template>It needs to be emphasized that connectionist networks are not models of how the 
nervous system works. The approach of connectionist networks is a hypothetical approach to represent categories 
in network patterns. Another name for the connectionist approach is Parallel 
Distributed Processing approach, for short PDP, since processing takes place 
in parallel lines and the output is distributed across many units.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE CONNECTIONISTS DID THIS BY MODELING THEIR NETWORKS AFTER NEURAL NETWORKS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM . EVERY NODE OF THE DIAGRAM REPRESENTS A NEURON-LIKE PROCESSING UNIT . THESE UNITS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE SUBGROUPS : INPUT UNITS WHICH BECOME ACTIVATED BY A STIMULATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HIDDEN UNITS WHICH RECEIVE SIGNALS FROM AN INPUT-UNIT AND PASS THEM TO AN OUTPUT UNIT AND OUTPUT UNITS WHICH SHOW A PATTERN OF ACTIVATION THAT REPRESENTS THE INITIAL STIMULUS . EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN UNITS JUST LIKE SYNAPSES IN THE BRAIN ALLOW ’ INPUT ’ TO BE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED . FOR COMPUTING THE OUTCOME OF SUCH SYSTEMS IT IS USEFUL TO ATTACH A CERTAIN ’ WEIGHT ’ TO THE INPUT OF THE CONNECTIONISTS SYSTEM THAT MIMICS THE STRENGTH OF A STIMULUS OF THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM</pattern>
<template>The connectionists did this by modeling their networks after neural networks 
in the nervous system. Every node of the diagram represents a neuron-like 
processing unit. These units can be divided into three subgroups: Input units, which become activated by a stimulation of the environment, hidden units, which receive signals from an input-unit and pass them to an output unit and output units, which show a pattern of activation that represents the initial stimulus. Excitatory and inhibitory connections between units just like synapses in the brain allow ’input’ to be analyzed and evaluated. For computing the outcome 
of such systems, it is useful to attach a certain ’weight’ to the input of the 
connectionists system, that mimics the strength of a stimulus of the human 
nervous system.</template>

<pattern>COLLINS AND LOFTUS ( 1975 ) TRIED TO ABANDON THESE PROBLEMS BY USING SHORTER OR LONGER LINKS DEPENDING ON THE RELATEDNESS AND INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN FORMERLY NOT DIRECTLY LINKED CONCEPTS . ALSO THE FORMER HIERARCHIC STRUCTURE WAS SUBSTITUTED BY A MORE INDIVIDUAL STRUCTURE OF A PERSON . ONLY TO NAME A FEW OF THE EXTENSIONS . AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE NEW MODEL REPRESENTS INTERPERSONAL DIFFERENCES SUCH AS ACQUIRED DURING A HUMANS LIFESPAN .

<template>Collins and Loftus (1975) tried to abandon these problems by using shorter or longer links 
depending on the relatedness and interconnections between formerly not directly linked 
concepts. Also the former hierarchic structure was substituted by a more individual structure 
of a person. Only to name a few of the extensions. As shown in the picture on the right, the 
new model represents interpersonal differences, such as acquired during a humans lifespan. 
They manifest themselves in the layout and the various lengths of the links of the same 
concepts.</template>

<pattern>THE TYPICALITY EFFECT IS ONE OF THEM . IT IS KNOWN THAT REACTION TIMES FOR MORE TYPICAL MEMBERS OF A CATEGORY ARE FASTER THAN FOR LESS TYPICAL MEMBERS . ( MITECS ) THIS CONTRADICTS THE ASSUMPTIONS OF COLLINS AND QUILLIAN S MODEL THAT THE DISTANCE IN THE NET IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REACTION TIME . IT WAS EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED THAT SOME PROPERTIES ARE STORED AT SPECIFIC NODES THEREFORE THE COGNITIVE ECONOMY STANDS IN QUESTION . FURTHERMORE THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF FASTER CONCEPT RETRIEVAL ALTHOUGH THE DISTANCES IN THE NETWORK ARE LONGER</pattern>
<template>The Typicality Effect is one of them. It is known that "reaction times for more typical 
members of a category are faster than for less typical members". (MITECS) This contradicts 
the assumptions of Collins' and Quillian's Model, that the distance in the net is 
responsible for reaction time.  It was experimentally determined that some properties are stored at specific nodes, therefore the cognitive economy stands in question. Furthermore, there are examples of faster concept retrieval although the distances in the 
network are longer.</template>

<pattern>THE PHENOMENON THAT ADJACENT CONCEPTS ARE ACTIVATED IS CALLED SPREADING ACTIVATION . THESE CONCEPTS ARE FAR MORE EASILY ACCESSED BY MEMORY THEY ARE PRIMED . THIS WAS STUDIED AND BACKED BY DAVID MEYER AND ROGER SCHANEVELDT ( 1971 ) WITH A LEXICAL-DECISION TASK . PROBANDS HAD TO DECIDE IF WORD PAIRS WERE WORDS OR NON-WORDS . THEY WERE FASTER AT FINDING REAL WORD PAIRS IF THE CONCEPTS OF THE TWO WORDS WERE CLOSE BY IN THE INTENDED NETWORK</pattern>
<template>The phenomenon that adjacent concepts are activated is called Spreading activation. These 
concepts are far more easily accessed by memory, they are "primed".  This was studied and backed by David Meyer and Roger Schaneveldt (1971) with a lexical-decision task. Probands had to decide if word pairs were words or non-words. They were 
faster at finding real word pairs if the concepts of the two words were close by in the 
intended network.</template>

<category>
<pattern>THE LOGIC STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORK IS CONVINCING SINCE IT CAN SHOW THAT THE TIME OF RETRIEVING A CONCEPT AND THE DISTANCES IN THE NETWORK CORRELATE . THE CORRELATION IS PROVEN BY THE SENTENCE-VERIFICATION TECHNIQUE . IN EXPERIMENTS PROBANDS HAD TO ANSWER STATEMENTS ABOUT CONCEPTS WITH YES OR NO . IT TOOK ACTUALLY LONGER TO SAY YES IF THE CONCEPT BEARING NODES WERE FURTHER APART</pattern>
<template>The logic structure of the network is convincing, since it can show that the time of retrieving 
a concept and the distances in the network correlate. The correlation is proven by the 
sentence-verification technique. In experiments probands had to answer statements about 
concepts with "yes" or "no". It took actually longer to say "yes", if the concept bearing nodes 
were further apart.</template>

<pattern>IN ORDER NOT TO PRODUCE REDUNDANCIES COLLINS AND QUILLIAN THOUGHT OF THIS AS AN INFORMATION INHERITANCE PRINCIPLE . INFORMATION THAT IS SHARED BY SEVERAL CONCEPTS IS STORED IN THE HIGHEST PARENT NODE CONTAINING THE INFORMATION . SO ALL SON-NODES THAT ARE BELOW THE INFORMATION BEARER ALSO CAN ACCESS THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPERTIES . HOWEVER THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS . SOMETIMES A SPECIAL CAR HAS NOT FOUR WHEELS BUT THREE . THIS SPECIFIC PROPERTY IS STORED IN THE SON-NODE</pattern>
<template>In order not to produce redundancies, Collins and Quillian thought of this as an information 
inheritance principle. Information, that is shared by several concepts, is stored in the highest 
parent node, containing the information. So all son-nodes, that are below the information 
bearer , also can access the information about the properties. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes a special car has not four wheels, but three. This specific 
property is stored in the son-node.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THESE PIECES OF INFORMATION MUST BE STORED SOMEWHERE . IT WOULD TAKE TOO MUCH SPACE IF EVERY DETAIL MUST BE STORED AT EVERY LEVEL . SO THE INFORMATION OF A CAR IS STORED AT THE BASIS LEVEL AND FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC CARS E.G . BMW IS STORED AT THE LOWER LEVEL WHERE YOU DO NOT NEED THE FACT THAT THE BMW ALSO HAS FOUR WHEELS IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT IS A CAR . THIS WAY OF STORING SHARED PROPERTIES AT A HIGHER-LEVEL NODE IS CALLED COGNITIVE ECONOMY</pattern>
<template>These pieces of information must be stored somewhere. It would take too much space, if every 
detail must be stored at every level. So the information of a car is stored at the basis level and 
further information about specific cars, e.g. BMW, is stored at the lower level, where you do not 
need the fact that the BMW also has four wheels, if you already know that it is a car. This way 
of storing shared properties at a higher-level node is called Cognitive Economy.</template>

<pattern>IN THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE COLLINS AND QUILLIANS NETWORK WITH ADDED PROPERTIES AT EACH NODE IS SHOWN . AS ALREADY MENTIONED THE SKELETON-NODES ARE INTERCONNECTED BY LINKS .

BY LOOKING AT THE CONCEPT CAR ONE GETS THE INFORMATION THAT A CAR HAS 4 WHEELS HAS AN ENGINE HAS WINDOWS AND FURTHERMORE MOVES AROUND NEEDS FUEL IS MANMADE</pattern>
<template>In the picture on the right hand side, Collins and Quillians network with added properties at 
each node is shown. As already mentioned, the skeleton-nodes are interconnected by links. At 
the nodes, concept names are added. Like in paragraph "Hierarchical Organisation of 
Categories", general concepts are on the top and more particular ones at the bottom. By 
looking at the concept "car", one gets the information that a car has 4 wheels, has an engine, 
has windows, and furthermore moves around, needs fuel, is manmade.</template>

networks, in other words, in a functional storage-system for the `meanings' of words. Of

represent a piece of knowledge about our world.</template>

<pattern>ANOTHER FACTOR IS CULTURE . IMAGINE A PEOPLE LIVING FOR INSTANCE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE THEREFORE A GREATER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PLANTS ETC . THAN FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS IN GERMANY . IF YOU ASK THE LATTER WHAT THEY SEE IN NATURE THEY USE THE BASIC LEVEL ‘ TREE ’ AND IF YOU DO THE SAME TASK FOR THE PEOPLE CLOSER TO NATURE THEY WILL TEND TO ANSWER IN TERMS OF LOWER LEVEL CONCEPTS SUCH AS ‘ OAK TREE ’</pattern>
<template>Another factor is culture. Imagine a people living for instance in close contact with their 
natural environment, and have therefore a greater knowledge about plants etc. than, for example, 
students in Germany. If you ask the latter what they see in nature, they use the basic level 
‘tree’ and if you do the same task for the people closer to nature they will tend to answer in terms of 
lower level concepts such as ‘oak tree’.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ONE FACTOR WHICH INFLUENCES OUR CATEGORIZATION IS KNOWLEDGE ITSELF . EXPERTS PAY MORE ATTENTION TO SPECIFIC FEATURES OF OBJECTS IN THEIR AREA THAN NON-EXPERTS WOULD DO . FOR EXAMPLE AFTER PRESENTING SOME PICTURES OF BIRDS EXPERTS OF BIRDS TEND TO SAY THE SUBORDINATE NAME ( BLACKBIRD SPARROW ) WHILE NON-EXPERTS JUST SAY BIRD . THE BASIC LEVEL IN THE AREA OF INTEREST OF AN EXPERT IS LOWER THAN THE BASIC LEVEL OF A LAYPERSON . THEREFORE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE AFFECT CATEGORIZATION</pattern>
<template>One factor which influences our categorization is knowledge itself. Experts pay more 
attention to specific features of objects in their area than non-experts would do. For example 
after presenting some pictures of birds experts of birds tend to say the subordinate name 
(blackbird, sparrow) while non-experts just say "bird". The basic level in the area of interest 
of an expert is lower than the basic level of a layperson. Therefore knowledge and experience 
of people affect categorization.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE DECREASE OF INFORMATION FROM BASIC TO SUPERORDINATE IS REALLY HIGH BUT THAT THE INCREASE OF INFORMATION FROM BASIC DOWN TO SUBORDINATE IS RATHER LOW . SCIENTISTS WANTED TO FIND OUT IF AMONG THESE LEVELS ONE IS PREFERRED OVER THE OTHERS . THEY ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO NAME PRESENTED OBJECTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE . THE RESULT WAS THAT THE SUBJECTS TENDED TO USE THE BASIC-LEVEL NAME WHICH INCLUDES THE OPTIMAL AMOUNT OF STORED INFORMATION . THEREFORE A PICTURE OF A RETRIEVER WOULD BE NAMED “ DOG ” RATHER THAN “ ANIMAL ” OR “ RETRIEVER ” . IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LEVELS ARE DIFFERENT FOR EACH PERSON DEPENDING ON FACTORS SUCH AS EXPERTISE AND CULTURE</pattern>
<template>It is interesting that the decrease of information from basic to superordinate is really high but 
that the increase of information from basic down to subordinate is rather low. Scientists 
wanted to find out if among these levels one is preferred over the others. They asked 
participants to name presented objects as quickly as possible. The result was that the subjects 
tended to use the basic-level name, which includes the optimal amount of stored information. 
Therefore a picture of a retriever would be named “dog” rather than “animal” or “retriever”. It is important to note that the levels are different for each person depending on factors such 
as expertise and culture.</template>

<pattern>NOW THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES OF HOW WE GO ABOUT FORMING CATEGORIES LET US LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF A CATEGORY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CATEGORIES . THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT LARGER CATEGORIES CAN BE SPLIT UP INTO MORE SPECIFIC AND SMALLER ONES</pattern>
<template>Now that we know about the different approaches of how we go about forming categories, let 
us look at the structure of a category and the relationship between categories.  The basic idea is that larger categories can be split up into more specific and smaller ones.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>SOME RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED THAT PEOPLE MAY USE BOTH APPROACHES : WHEN WE INITIALLY LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT A CATEGORY WE AVERAGE SEEN EXEMPLARS INTO A PROTOTYPE . IT WOULD BE VERY BAD IN EARLY LEARNING IF WE ALREADY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT EXCEPTIONS A CATEGORY HAS . IN GETTING TO KNOW SOME OF THESE EXEMPLARS MORE IN DETAIL THE INFORMATION BECOMES STRENGTHENED</pattern>
<template>Some researchers concluded that people may use both approaches: When we initially learn 
something about a category we average seen exemplars into a prototype. It would be very bad 
in early learning, if we already take into account what exceptions a category has. In getting to know some of these exemplars more in detail the information becomes strengthened.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>FOR BOTH PROTOTYPE AND EXEMPLAR APPROACH THERE ARE EXPERIMENTS WHOSE RESULTS SUPPORT EITHER ONE APPROACH . SOME PEOPLE CLAIM THAT THE EXEMPLAR APPROACH HAS LESS PROBLEMS WITH VARIABLE CATEGORIES AND WITH ATYPICAL CASES WITHIN CATEGORIES . E.G . THE CATEGORY “ GAMES ” IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO REALISE WITH THE PROTOTYPE APPROACH . HOW DO YOU WANT TO FIND AN AVERAGE CASE FOR ALL GAMES LIKE FOOTBALL GOLF CHESS . THE REASON FOR THAT COULD BE THAT “ REAL ” CATEGORY- MEMBERS ARE USED AND ALL INFORMATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL EXEMPLARS WHICH CAN BE USEFUL WHEN ENCOUNTERING OTHER MEMBERS LATER ARE STORED . ANOTHER POINT WHERE THE APPROACHES CAN BE COMPARED IS HOW WELL THEY WORK FOR DIFFERENTLY SIZED CATEGORIES . THE EXEMPLAR APPROACH SEEMS TO WORK BETTER FOR SMALLER CATEGORIES AND PROTOTYPES DO BETTER FOR LARGER CATEGORIES</pattern>
<template>For both prototype and exemplar approach there are experiments whose results support either 
one approach. Some people claim that the exemplar approach has less problems with variable 
categories and with atypical cases within categories. E.g. the category “games” is quite 
difficult to realise with the prototype approach. How do you want to find an average case for 
all games, like football, golf, chess. The reason for that could be that “real” category- 
members are used and all information of the individual exemplars, which can be useful when 
encountering other members later, are stored. Another point where the approaches can be 
compared is how well they work for differently sized categories. The exemplar approach seems 
to work better for smaller categories and prototypes do better for larger categories.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>AGAIN WE CAN SHOW THE TYPICALITY EFFECT : OBJECTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO MANY EXAMPLES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE CLASSIFIED FASTER TO OBJECTS WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO FEW EXAMPLES . YOU HAVE SEEN A SPARROW MORE OFTEN IN YOUR LIFE THAN A PENGUIN SO YOU SHOULD RECOGNISE THE SPARROW FASTER</pattern>
<template>Again we can show the typicality effect: Objects that are similar to many examples we have 
encountered are classified faster to objects which are similar to few examples. You have seen 
a sparrow more often in your life than a penguin, so you should recognise the sparrow faster.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE TYPICALITY EFFECT CAN ALSO BE EXPLAINED BY A THIRD APPROACH WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH EXEMPLARS . SIMILAR TO A PROTOTYPE AN EXEMPLAR IS A VERY TYPICAL MEMBER OF THE CATEGORY . THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXEMPLARS AND PROTOTYPES IS THAT EXEMPLARS ARE ACTUALLY EXISTENT MEMBERS OF A CATEGORY THAT A PERSON HAS ENCOUNTERED IN THE PAST . NEVERTHELESS IT INVOLVES ALSO THE SIMILARITY OF AN OBJECT TO A STANDARD OBJECT . ONLY THAT THE STANDARD HERE INVOLVES MANY EXAMPLES AND NOT THE AVERAGE EACH ONE CALLED AN EXEMPLAR</pattern>
<template>The typicality effect can also be explained by a third approach which is concerned with 
exemplars. Similar to a prototype, an exemplar is a very typical member of the category. The 
difference between exemplars and prototypes is that exemplars are actually existent members 
of a category that a person has encountered in the past. Nevertheless, it involves also the 
similarity of an object to a standard object. Only that the standard here involves many 
examples and not the average, each one called an exemplar.</template>

SINCE WE ARE ABLE TO FIND AN EXPLANATION THE QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES ARE : HOW ARE WE ABLE TO ABSTRACT FROM PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND WHY DO WE NOT START ALL OVER AGAIN IF WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH A SLIGHTLY NEW SITUATION ?

we are able to find an explanation, the questions we need to ask ourselves are: How are we 
able to abstract from prior knowledge and why do we not start all over again if we are

Where, for example, is memory located, and which parts of the brain are relevant for emotions and motivation? In this chapter we focus on the general differences between the right and the left hemisphere. We consider the question whether they differ in what and how they process information and give an overview about experiments that contributed to the scientific progress in this field.</template>

<pattern>ACCORDING TO MANY RESEARCHERS LANGUAGE IS THE SET OF PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BUILD UP THE SITUATION MODEL OF THE REPRESENTED SITUATION ( GERNSBACHER 1990 ; GIVON 1992 ; KINTSCH 1992 ; ZWAAN & RADVANSKY 1998 ) . AS MENTIONED READERS USE THE LEXICAL CUES AND INFORMATION TO CONNECT THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONAL DIMENSIONS AND INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE MODEL . ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS PRIOR WORLD KNOWLEDGE . WORLD KNOWLEDGE ALSO INFLUENCES HOW THE DIFFERENT INFORMATION IN A SITUATION MODEL ARE RELATED . THE RELATION BETWEEN LINGUISTIC CUES AND WORLD KNOWLEDGE IS THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT TOPIC OF CURRENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH IN THE AREA OF SITUATION MODELS</pattern>
<template>According to many researchers, language is the set of processing instructions on how to build up the Situation Model of the represented situation (Gernsbacher, 1990; Givon, 1992; Kintsch, 1992; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). As mentioned, readers use the lexical cues and information to connect the different situational dimensions and integrate them into the model. Another important point here is prior world knowledge. World knowledge also influences how the different information in a situation model are related. The relation between linguistic cues and world knowledge is therefore an important topic of current and future research in the area of Situation Models.</template>

THE IDEA OF BASING PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF REASONING ON CONTENT SPECIFIC RULES WAS DISCUSSED BY JOHNSON-LAIRD AND WASON AND VARIOUS SORTS OF SUCH THEORIES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED . A RELATED IDEA IS THAT REASONING DEPENDS ON THE ACCUMULATION OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WITHIN A CONNECTIONIST FRAMEWORK WHERE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INFERENCE AND RECALL IS BLURRED</pattern>
<template>The second class of theories postulate content specific rules of inference. Their origin lies in programming languages and production systems. They work with forms like "If x is a, then x is b". If one wants to show that x is b, showing that x is a sub-goal of this argumentation. The idea of basing psychological theories of reasoning on content specific rules was discussed by Johnson-Laird and Wason and various sorts of such theories have been proposed. A related idea is that reasoning depends on the accumulation of specific examples within a connectionist framework, where the distinction between inference and recall is blurred.</template>

<pattern>CAUSAL INFERENCES CREATE CAUSAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TEXT ELEMENTS . THESE CONNECTIONS ARE SEPARATED INTO LOCAL CONNECTIONS AND GLOBAL CONNECTIONS . LOCAL CONNECTIONS ARE MADE WITHIN A RANGE OF 1 TO 3 SENTENCES . THIS DEPENDS ON FACTORS LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE WORKING MEMORY AND THE CONCENTRATION DUE READING . GLOBAL CONNECTIONS ARE DRAWN BETWEEN THE INFORMATION IN ONE SENTENCE TOGETHER WITH THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION GATHERED SO FAR ABOUT THE WHOLE TEXT . PROBLEMS CAN OCCUR WITH CAUSAL INFERENCES WHEN A STORY IS INCONSISTENT . FOR EXAMPLE VEGANS EATING STEAK WOULD BE INCONSISTENT . AN INTERESTING FACT ABOUT CAUSAL INFERENCES ( GOLDSTEIN 2005 ) IS THAT THE KIND OF INFERENCES WE DRAW HERE THAT ARE NOT EASILY SEEN AT FIRST ARE EASIER TO REMEMBER . THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY REQUIRED A HIGHER MENTAL PROCESSING CAPACITY WHILE DRAWING THE INFERENCE . SO THIS NOT-SO-EASY INFERENCE SEEMS TO BE MARKED IN A WAY THAT IT IS EASIER TO REMEMBER IT</pattern>
<template>Causal inferences create causal connections between text elements. These connections are separated into local connections and global connections. Local connections are made within a range of 1 to 3 sentences. This depends on factors like the capacity of the working memory and the concentration due reading. Global connections are drawn between the information in one sentence together with the background information gathered so far about the whole text. Problems can occur with Causal Inferences when a story is inconsistent. For example, vegans eating steak would be inconsistent. An interesting fact about Causal Inferences (Goldstein, 2005) is that the kind of Inferences we draw here that are not easily seen at first are easier to remember. This may be due to the fact that they required a higher mental processing capacity while drawing the inference. So this "not-so-easy" inference seems to be marked in a way that it is easier to remember it.</template>

<pattern>CAUSAL INFERENCE IS THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE EVENT CAUSED ANOTHER IN THE TEXT LIKE IN HE HIT HIS NAIL . SO HIS FINGER ACHED . THE FIRST SENTENCE GIVES THE REASON WHY THE SITUATION DESCRIBED IN THE SECOND SENTENCE CAME TO BE . IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO DRAW A CAUSAL INFERENCE IN AN EXAMPLE LIKE HE HIT HIS NAIL . SO HIS FATHER RAN AWAY ALTHOUGH ONE COULD CREATE AN INFERENCE ON THIS WITH SOME FANTASY</pattern>
<template>Causal Inference is the conclusion that one event caused another in the text, like in "He hit his nail. So his finger ached". The first sentence gives the reason why the situation described in the second sentence came to be. It would be more difficult to draw a causal inference in an example like "He hit his nail. So his father ran away", although one could create an inference on this with some fantasy.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THIS KIND OF INFERENCING USUALLY CONNECTS OBJECTS OR PERSONS FROM ONE TO ANOTHER SENTENCE . THEREFORE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONNECTING CROSS-SENTENCE INFORMATION . E.G . IN JOHN HIT THE NAIL . HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STROKE WE DIRECTLY INFER THAT HE AND HIS RELATE TO JOHN . WE NORMALLY MAKE THIS KIND OF INFERENCE QUITE EASILY . BUT THERE CAN BE SENTENCES WHERE MORE PERSONS AND OTHER WORDS RELATING TO THEM ARE MIXED UP AND PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS UNDERSTANDING THE STORY AT FIRST . THIS IS NORMALLY REGARDED AS BAD WRITING STYLE</pattern>
<template>This kind of Inferencing usually connects objects or persons from one to another sentence. Therefore it is responsible for connecting cross-sentence information. E.g. in "John hit the nail. He was proud of his stroke", we directly infer that "he" and "his" relate to "John". We normally make this kind of inference quite easily. But there can be sentences where more persons and other words relating to them are mixed up and people have problems understanding the story at first. This is normally regarded as bad writing style.</template>

<pattern>WHILE READING A TEXT INFERENCING CREATES INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE TEXT ; HENCE IT IS A CREATIVE PROCESS . IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TEXT UNDERSTANDING IN GENERAL BECAUSE TEXTS CANNOT INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE SENSE OF A STORY . TEXTS USUALLY LEAVE OUT WHAT IS KNOWN AS WORLD KNOWLEDGE . WORLD KNOWLEDGE IS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SITUATIONS PERSONS OR ITEMS THAT MOST PEOPLE SHARE AND THEREFORE DON T NEED TO BE EXPLICITLY STATED . EACH PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO INFER THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE USUALLY USE HAMMERS TO POUND NAILS . IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WRITE A TEXT IF IT HAD TO INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION IT DEALS WITH ; IF THERE WAS NO SUCH THING LIKE INFERENCING OR IF IT WAS NOT AUTOMATICALLY DONE BY OUR BRAIN</pattern>
<template>While reading a text, inferencing creates information which is not explicitly stated in the text; hence it is a creative process. It is very important for text understanding in general, because texts cannot include all information needed to understand the sense of a story. Texts usually leave out what is known as world knowledge. World knowledge is knowledge about situations, persons or items that most people share, and therefore don't need to be explicitly stated. Each person should be able to infer this kind of information, as for example that we usually use hammers to pound nails. It would be impossible to write a text, if it had to include all information it deals with; if there was no such thing like inferencing or if it was not automatically done by our brain.</template>

FINALLY THE SITUATION MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED BY THE “ TEXT BASE ” REPRESENTATION . WE CAN SEE THAT THE SITUATION MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY KIND OF TEXT . IT IS A MENTAL PICTURE OF INFORMATION IN THE SENTENCE ITSELF</pattern>
<template>This theory says that there exist three levels of representation the surface form, text base and the situation model. In this example the sentence “The frog ate the bug.” Is already the surface form. We naturally create semantically relations to understand the sentence (semantic tree in the figure). The next level is the “Text base”. [EAT(FROG, BUG)] is the propositional representation and Text base is close to this kind of representation, except that it is rather spatial. Finally the situation model is constructed by the “Text base” representation. We can see that the situation model does not include any kind of text. It is a mental picture of information in the sentence itself.</template>

<pattern>ACCORDING TO THE IEF THE PROCESS OF LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS THESE ARE ACTIVATION CONSTRUAL AND INTEGRATION . EACH COMPONENT WORKS AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL . ACTIVATION WORKS AT THE WORLD LEVEL CONSTRUAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLAUSE LEVEL WHILE INTEGRATION IS ACTIVE AT THE DISCOURSE LEVEL . THOUGH THE IEF SHARES MANY POINTS WITH EARLIER MODELS OF LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION IT DIFFERS IN SOME MAIN POINTS . FOR EXAMPLE IT SUGGESTS THAT LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION INVOLVES ACTION AND PERCEPTUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT AMODAL PROPOSITIONS ( ZWAAN 2003 )</pattern>
<template>According to the IEF the process of language comprehension consists of three components, these are activation, construal and integration. Each component works at a different level. Activation works at the world level, construal is responsible for the clause level while integration is active at the discourse level. Though the IEF shares many points with earlier models of language comprehension it differs in some main points. For example it suggests that language comprehension involves action and perceptual representations and not amodal propositions (Zwaan, 2003).</template>

ACCORDING TO ZWAAN ( 2003 ) THE IEF SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN ENGINE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION . THESE PREDICTIONS ARE THEN SUGGESTED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH</pattern>
<template>The main point of the Immersed Experiencer Framework is the idea that words active experiences with their referents. For example "an eagle in the sky" activates a visual experience of a eagle with stretched-out wings while "an eagle in the nest" activates a different visual experience. According to Zwaan (2003) the IEF should be seen as an engine to make predictions about language comprehension. These predictions are then suggested for further research.</template>

In every cycle the new propositions are connected to existing ones, they therefore form a connected and hierarchical set.</template>

<pattern>COMPREHENDERS ARE QUICK TO MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT PROTAGONISTS PRESUMABLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONSTRUCT A MORE COMPLETE SITUATION MODEL . CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SUBJECTS READ THE SENTENCE THE ELECTRICIAN EXAMINED THE LIGHT FITTING . IF THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE IS SHE TOOK OUT HER SCREWDRIVER THEIR READING SPEED IS SLOWED DOWN COMPARED WITH WHEN THE SECOND SENTENCE IS HE TOOK OUT HIS SCREWDRIVER . THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE SHE PROVIDES A MISMATCH WITH THE STEREOTYPICAL GENDER OF AN ELECTRICIAN WHICH THE SUBJECTS APPARENTLY INFERRED WHILE READING THE FIRST SENTENCE ( CARREIRAS GARNHAM OAKHILL & CAIN 1996 )</pattern>
<template>Comprehenders are quick to make inferences about protagonists, presumably in an attempt to construct a more complete situation model. Consider, for example, what happens after subjects read the sentence The electrician examined the light fitting. If the following sentence is She took out her screwdriver, their reading speed is slowed down compared with when the second sentence is He took out his screwdriver. This happens because she provides a mismatch with the stereotypical gender of an electrician, which the subjects apparently inferred while reading the first sentence (Carreiras, Garnham, Oakhill, & Cain, 1996).</template>

<pattern>WE ARE OFTEN ABLE TO PREDICT PEOPLE ’ S FUTURE ACTIONS BY INFERRING THEIR INTENTIONALITY I.E . THEIR GOALS . FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SEE A MAN WALKING OVER TO A CHAIR WE ASSUME THAT HE WANTS TO SIT ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS BEEN STANDING FOR A LONG TIME . THUS WE MIGHT GENERATE THE INFERENCE “ HE IS GOING TO SIT . ” KEEFE AND MCDANIEL ( 1993 ) PRESENTED SUBJECTS WITH SENTENCES LIKE AFTER STANDING THROUGH THE 3 - HR DEBATE THE TIRED SPEAKER WALKED OVER TO HIS CHAIR ( AND SAT DOWN ) AND THEN WITH PROBE WORDS ( E.G . SAT IN THIS CASE ) . SUBJECTS TOOK ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO NAME SAT WHEN THE CLAUSE ABOUT THE SPEAKER SITTING DOWN WAS OMITTED AND WHEN IT WAS INCLUDED . MOREOVER NAMING TIMES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER IN BOTH OF THESE CONDITIONS THAN IN A CONTROL CONDITION IN WHICH IT WAS IMPLIED THAT THE SPEAKER REMAINED STANDING</pattern>
<template>We are often able to predict people’s future actions by inferring their intentionality, i.e. their goals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference “He is going to sit.” Keefe and McDaniel (1993) presented subjects with sentences like After standing through the 3-hr debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down) and then with probe words (e.g., sat, in this case). Subjects took about the same amount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted and when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these conditions than in a control condition in which it was implied that the speaker remained standing.</template>

<pattern>SUBJECTS WERE FASTER IN RESPONDING TO 1C AFTER THE SEQUENCE 1A-1B THAN AFTER 1A ’ -1B .

HOWEVER BECAUSE THIS KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BE USED TO VALIDATE 1A ’ -1B IT WAS NOT ACTIVATED WHEN SUBJECTS READ THAT SENTENCE PAIR</pattern>
<template>Subjects were faster in responding to 1c after the sequence 1a-1b than after 1a’-1b. According to Singer, the reason for the speed difference is that the knowledge that water extinguishes fire was activated to validate the events described in 1a-1b. However, because this knowledge cannot be used to validate 1a’-1b, it was not activated when subjects read that sentence pair.</template>

<pattern>PEOPLE ’ S INTERPRETATION OF THE MEANING OF A VERB DENOTING MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OR OBJECTS IN SPACE SUCH AS TO APPROACH DEPENDS ON THEIR SITUATION MODELS . FOR EXAMPLE COMPREHENDERS INTERPRET THE MEANING OF APPROACH DIFFERENTLY IN THE TRACTOR IS JUST APPROACHING THE FENCE THAN IN THE MOUSE IS JUST APPROACHING THE FENCE . SPECIFICALLY THEY INTERPRET THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FIGURE AND THE LANDMARK AS BEING LONGER WHEN THE FIGURE IS LARGE ( TRACTOR ) COMPARED WITH WHEN IT IS SMALL ( MOUSE ) . THE COMPREHENDERS ’ INTERPRETATION ALSO DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE LANDMARK AND THE SPEED OF THE FIGURE ( MORROW & CLARK 1988 ) . APPARENTLY COMPREHENDERS BEHAVE AS IF THEY ARE ACTUALLY STANDING IN THE SITUATION LOOKING AT THE TRACTOR OR MOUSE APPROACHING A FENCE</pattern>
<template>People’s interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting movement of people or objects in space, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. For example, comprehenders interpret the meaning of approach differently in  The tractor is just approaching the fence than in The mouse is just approaching the fence. Specifically, they interpret the distance between the figure and the landmark as being longer when the figure is large (tractor) compared with when it is small (mouse). The comprehenders’ interpretation also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure (Morrow & Clark, 1988). Apparently, comprehenders behave as if they are actually standing in the situation, looking at the tractor or mouse approaching a fence.</template>

<pattern>WHEN COMPREHENDERS HAVE EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPATIAL LAYOUT OF THE SETTING OF THE STORY ( E.G . A BUILDING ) THEY UPDATE THEIR REPRESENTATIONS ACCORDING TO THE LOCATION AND GOALS OF THE PROTAGONIST . THEY HAVE THE FASTEST MENTAL ACCESS TO THE ROOM THAT THE PROTAGONIST IS CURRENTLY IN OR IS HEADING TO . FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN MORE READILY SAY WHETHER OR NOT TWO OBJECTS ARE IN THE SAME ROOM IF THE ROOM MENTIONED IS ONE OF THESE ROOMS THAN IF IT IS SOME OTHER ROOM IN THE BUILDING ( E.G . MORROW GREENSPAN & BOWER 1987 ) . THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE INTUITIVELY BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ROOMS THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT TO US IF WE WERE IN THE SITUATION</pattern>
<template>When comprehenders have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the setting of the story (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is currently in or is heading to. For example, they can more readily say whether or not two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is one of these rooms than if it is some other room in the building (e.g., Morrow, Greenspan, & Bower, 1987). This makes perfect sense intuitively because these are the rooms that would be relevant to us if we were in the situation.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>VERY OFTEN OBJECTS THAT ARE SPATIALLY CLOSE TO US ARE MORE RELEVANT THAN MORE DISTANT OBJECTS . THEREFORE ONE WOULD EXPECT THE SAME FOR SITUATION MODELS . CONSISTENT WITH THIS IDEA COMPREHENDERS ARE SLOWER TO RECOGNISE WORDS DENOTING OBJECTS DISTANT FROM A PROTAGONIST THAN THOSE DENOTING OBJECTS CLOSE TO THE PROTAGONIST ( GLENBERG MEYER & LINDEM 1987 )</pattern>
<template>Very often, objects that are spatially close to us are more relevant than more distant objects. Therefore, one would expect the same for situation models. consistent with this idea, comprehenders are slower to recognise words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those denoting objects close to the protagonist (Glenberg, Meyer & Lindem, 1987).</template>

REFERENTS CAN BE THE SAME OR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE “ COLD WAR ” CAN JUST BE FIGURED OUT BY THE USAGE OF DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS .

<pattern>THE EXPLANATION OF SIMILARITIES IN COMPREHENSION PERFORMANCES ACROSS MODALITIES CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE USAGE OF SITUATION MODELS . IF WE READ A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WATCH A REPORT ON TELEVISION OR LISTEN TO A REPORT ON RADIO WE COME UP WITH A SIMILAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SAME INFORMATION WHICH IS CONVEYED THROUGH DIFFERENT MODALITIES . THUS WE CREATE A MENTAL REPRESENTATION OF THE INFORMATION OR EVENT . THIS MENTAL REPRESENTATION DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE MODALITIES ITSELF . FURTHERMORE THERE IS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THIS INTUITION . BAGGETT ( 1979 ) FOUND OUT THAT STUDENTS WHO SAW A SHORT FILM AND STUDENTS WHO HEARD A SPOKEN VERSION OF THE EVENTS IN THE SHORT FILM FINALLY PRODUCED A STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR RECALL PROTOCOL . THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN THE PROTOCOLS OF THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE DUE TO CONTENT ASPECTS . LIKE THE TEXT VERSION EXPLICITLY STATED THAT A BOY WAS ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL AND IN THE MOVIE THIS HAD TO BE INFERRED</pattern>
<template>The explanation of similarities in comprehension performances across modalities can only be done by the usage of situation models. 
If we read a newspaper article, watch a report on television or listen to a report on radio, we come up with a similar understanding of the same information, which is conveyed through different modalities. Thus we create a mental representation of the information or event. This mental representation does not depend on the modalities itself. Furthermore there is empirical evidence for this intuition. 
Baggett (1979) found out that students who saw a short film and students who heard a spoken version of the events in the short film finally produced a structurally similar recall protocol. There were differences in the protocols of the two groups but the differences were due to content aspects. Like the text version explicitly stated that a boy was on his way to school and in the movie this had to be inferred.</template>

<pattern>THIS EXAMPLE ONLY MAKES SENSE TO THE READER IF HE IS AWARE THAT “ GERHARD SCHROEDER ” “ EX-GERMAN CHANCELLOR ” AND “ THE LEADER OF THE JUSOS IN 1971 ” IS ONE AND THE SAME PERSON . IF WE BUILD UP A SITUATION MODEL IN THIS EXAMPLE “ GERHARD SCHROEDER ” IS OUR TOKEN . EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION WHICH COMES UP WILL BE LINKED TO THIS TOKEN BASED ON GRAMMATICAL AND WORLD KNOWLEDGE . THE DEFINITE ARTICLE IN THE SECOND SENTENCE REFERS TO THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE FIRST SENTENCE . THIS IS BASED ON GRAMMATICAL KNOWLEDGE . EVERY DEFINITE ARTICLE INDICATES A CONNECTION TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN A PREVIOUS SENTENCE . IF THERE WOULD BE AN INDEFINITE ARTICLE WE HAVE TO BUILD A NEW TOKEN FOR A NEW INDIVIDUAL . THE THIRD SENTENCE IS LINKED BY DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE TO THE TOKEN . IT HAS TO BE KNOWN THAT “ GERHARD SCHROEDER ” WAS THE LEADER OF THE JUSOS IN 1971 . OTHERWISE THE CONNECTION CAN ONLY BE GUESSED . WE CAN SEE THAT AN INTEGRATED SITUATION MODEL IS NEEDED TO COMPREHEND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THREE SENTENCES</pattern>
<template>This example only makes sense to the reader if he is aware that “Gerhard Schroeder”, “Ex-German chancellor” and “the leader of the Jusos in 1971” is one and the same person. 
If we build up a situation model, in this example “Gerhard Schroeder” is our token. Every bit of information which comes up will be linked to this token, based on grammatical and world knowledge. The definite article in the second sentence refers to the individual in the first sentence. This is based on grammatical knowledge. Every definite article indicates a connection to an individual in a previous sentence. If there would be an indefinite article, we have to build a new token for a new individual. The third sentence is linked by domain knowledge to the token. It has to be known that “Gerhard Schroeder” was the leader of the Jusos in 1971. Otherwise the connection can only be guessed. 
We can see that an integrated situation model is needed to comprehend the connection between the three sentences.</template>

The P600 ERP`s in the Broca area, measured as a response to ungrammatical sentences, is also elicited in subjects listening to musical chord sequences lacking harmony (Patel, 2003) – the expectation of typical sequences in music could therefore be mediated by the same neural mechanisms as the expectation of grammatical sequences in language.</template>

<pattern>ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A DOUBLE DISSOCIATION OF LANGUAGE AND MUSIC ABILITIES . PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM AMUSIA ARE UNABLE TO PERCEIVE HARMONY TO REMEMBER AND TO RECOGNIZE EVEN VERY SIMPLE MELODIES ; AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE NO PROBLEMS IN COMPREHENDING OR PRODUCING SPEECH . THERE IS EVEN A CASE OF A PATIENT WHO DEVELOPED AMUSIA WITHOUT APROSODIA I.E . ALTHOUGH SHE COULDN T RECOGNIZE TONE IN MUSICAL SEQUENCES SHE NEVERTHELESS COULD STILL MAKE USE OF PITCH LOUDNESS RATE OR RHYTHM TO CONVEY MEANINGS IN SPOKEN LANGUAGE ( PEARCE 2005 ) . THIS HIGHLY SELECTIVE PROBLEM IN PROCESSING MUSIC ( AMUSIA ) CAN OCCUR AS A RESULT OF BRAIN DAMAGE OR BE INBORN ; IN SOME CASES IT RUNS ON FAMILIES SUGGESTING A GENETIC COMPONENT .

<template>On the one hand, there is evidence that there is a double dissociation of language and music abilities. People suffering from amusia are unable to perceive harmony, to remember and to recognize even very simple melodies; at the same time they have no problems in comprehending or producing speech. There is even a case of a patient who developed amusia without aprosodia, i.e. although she couldn't recognize tone in musical sequences, she nevertheless could still make use of pitch, loudness, rate, or rhythm to convey meanings in spoken language (Pearce, 2005). This highly selective problem in processing music (amusia) can occur as a result of brain damage, or be inborn; in some cases it runs on families, suggesting a genetic component. The complement syndrome of amusia also exists – after suffering a brain damage in the left hemisphere, the Russian composer Shebalin lost his speech functions, but his musical abilities remained intact (Zatorre, McGill, 2005).</template>

<template>Like language, music is a human universal involving some combinatorial principles that govern the organizing of discrete elements (tones) into structures (phrases) that convey some meaning – music is a symbolic system with a special kind of syntax and semantics. It’s therefore interesting to ask whether music and natural language share some neural mechanisms: whether processing of music is dependent on processing of language or the other way round, or whether the underlying mechanisms underlying them are completely separate. By investigating the neural mechanisms underlying music we might find out whether the neural processes behind language are unique to the domain of natural language, i.e. whether language is modular. Up to now, research in the neurobiology of music has yielded contradicting evidence regarding these questions.</template>

<template>The direction in which the sign is made often determines the subject and the object of a sentence. Nouns in SL can be 'linked' to a particular point in space, and later in the discourse they can be referred to by pointing to that same spot again (this is functionally related to pronouns in English). The object and the subject can then be switched by changing the direction in which the sign for a transitive verb is made.</template>

ONE DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF SL PHONEMES IS THE PLACE OF ARTICULATION – ONE HAND SHAPE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT MEANINGS DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT ’ S PRODUCED AT THE EYE- NOSE- OR CHIN-LEVEL . OTHER FEATURES DETERMINING THE MEANING OF A SIGN ARE HAND SHAPE PALM ORIENTATION MOVEMENT AND NON-MANUAL MARKERS ( E.G . FACIAL EXPRESSIONS )</pattern>
<template>Sign languages are phonological languages - every meaningful sign consists of several phonemes (phonemes used to be called cheremes (Greek χερι: hand) until their cognitive equivalence to phonemes in spoken languages was realized) that carry no meaning as such, but are nevertheless important to distinguish the meaning of the sign. One distinctive feature of SL phonemes is the place of articulation – one hand shape can have different meanings depending on whether it’s produced at the eye-, nose-, or chin-level.  Other features determining the meaning of a sign are hand shape, palm orientation, movement, and non-manual markers (e.g. facial expressions).</template>

Some Japanese patients can thus read kana but not kanji (surface alexia), whereas other can read kanji but not kana (phonological alexia). In addition, there is evidence that different brain regions of Japanese native speakers are active while reading kana and kanji, although like in the case of English native speakers, these regions also overlap.</template>

THE FOLLOWING SECTION SHOWS HOW NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH OF THREE SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS EACH DIFFERENT FROM ENGLISH IN SOME ASPECT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH - AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT - BETWEEN BRAIN REGIONS THAT DEAL WITH THE MODALITY OF THE LANGUAGE ( AND THEREFORE MAY VARY FROM LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE LANGUAGE IN QUESTION IS E.G .

However, looking at different language systems from a neuroscientific perspective can substantiate as well as differentiate acknowledged theories of language processing. The following section shows how neurological research of three symbolic systems, each different from English in some aspect, has made it possible to distinguish  - at least to some extent - between brain regions that deal with the modality of the language (and therefore may vary from language to language, depending on whether the language in question is e.g. spoken or signed) from brain regions that seem to be necessary to language processing in general  - regardless whether we are dealing with signed, spoken, or even musical language.</template>

MOREOVER DIVIDED VISUAL FIELD STUDIES REVEAL THAT THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE CAN BETTER DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SHAPES OF THE SAME LETTER ( E.G . IN DIFFERENT HANDWRITINGS ) THAN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE . THE CONTRIBUTION OF VISUAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ON BOTH HEMISPHERES IS THAT THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE FIRST RECOGNIZES A WRITTEN WORD AS LETTER SEQUENCES NO MATTER HOW EXACTLY THEY LOOK LIKE THEN THE LANGUAGE NETWORK IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE BUILDS UP AN ABSTRACT REPRESENTATION OF THE WORD WHICH IS THE COMPREHENSION OF THE WORD</pattern>
<template>The opposite hemisphere, the right hemisphere, is in contrast to the left hemisphere, not involved in abstract mapping of word meaning but is rather responsible for encoding word specific visual forms.
ERP and PET studies provides evidence that the right hemisphere responds in a stronger manner than the left hemisphere to letter like strings.  Moreover divided visual field studies reveal that the right hemisphere can better distinguish between different shapes of the same letter (e.g. in different handwritings) than the left hemisphere.
The contribution of visual language processing on both hemispheres is that the right hemisphere first recognizes a written word as letter sequences, no matter how exactly they look like, then the language network in the left hemisphere builds up an abstract representation of the word, which is the comprehension of the word.</template>

<pattern>DEEP ALEXIA SHARES MANY SYMPTOMATIC FEATURES WITH PHONOLOGICAL ALEXIA SUCH AS AN INABILITY TO READ OUT NON-WORDS . JUST AS IN PHONOLOGICAL ALEXIA PATIENTS MAKE MISTAKES ON WORD INFLECTIONS AS WELL AS FUNCTION WORDS AND SHOW VISUALLY BASED ERRORS ON ABSTRACT WORDS ( “ DESIRE ” → “ DESERT ” ) . IN ADDITION TO THAT PEOPLE WITH DEEP ALEXIA MISREAD WORDS AS DIFFERENT WORDS WITH A STRONGLY RELATED MEANING ( “ WOODS ” INSTEAD OF “ FOREST ” ) A PHENOMENON REFERRED TO AS SEMANTIC PARALEXIA . COLTHEART ( AS REFERRED TO IN THE “ HANDBOOK OF NEUROLINGUISTICS ” CH.41 - 3 P .   563 ) POSTULATES THAT READING IN DEEP DYSLEXIA IS MEDIATED BY THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE . HE SUGGESTS THAT WHEN LARGE LESIONS AFFECTING LANGUAGE ABILITIES OTHER THAN READING PREVENT ACCESS TO THE LEFT HEMISPHERE THE RIGHT-HEMISPHERIC LANGUAGE STORE IS USED . LEXICAL ENTRIES STORED THERE ARE ACCESSED AND USED AS INPUT TO LEFT-HEMISPHERE OUTPUT SYSTEMS</pattern>
<template>Deep Alexia shares many symptomatic features with phonological alexia such as an inability to read out non-words. Just as in phonological alexia, patients make mistakes on word inflections as well as function words and show visually based errors on abstract words (“desire” → “desert”). In addition to that, people with deep alexia misread words as different words with a strongly related meaning (“woods” instead of “forest”), a phenomenon referred to as semantic paralexia. Coltheart (as referred to in the “Handbook of Neurolinguistics”, ch.41-3, p. 563) postulates that reading in deep dyslexia is mediated by the right hemisphere. He suggests that when large lesions affecting language abilities other than reading prevent access to the left hemisphere, the right-hemispheric language store is used. Lexical entries stored there are accessed and used as input to left-hemisphere output systems.</template>

<pattern>WORD CLASS EFFECTS AND MORPHOLOGICAL ERRORS ARE COMMON TOO . NOUNS FOR EXAMPLE ARE READ BETTER THAN FUNCTION WORDS AND SOMETIMES EVEN BETTER THAN VERBS . AFFIXES WHICH DO NOT CHANGE THE GRAMMATICAL CLASS OR MEANING OF A WORD ( INFLECTIONAL AFFIXES ) ARE OFTEN SUBSTITUTED ( E.G . “ FARMER ” INSTEAD OF “ FARMING ” ) . FURTHERMORE CONCRETE WORDS ARE READ WITH A LOWER ERROR RATE THAN ABSTRACT ONES LIKE “ FREEDOM ” ( CONCRETENESS EFFECT )</pattern>
<template>Word class effects and morphological errors are common, too. Nouns, for example, are read better than function words and sometimes even better than verbs. Affixes which do not change the grammatical class or meaning of a word (inflectional affixes) are often substituted (e.g. “farmer” instead of “farming”). Furthermore, concrete words are read with a lower error rate than abstract ones like “freedom” (concreteness effect).</template>

<pattern>IN CONTRAST PHONOLOGICAL ALEXIA IS CHARACTERISED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE PHONOLOGICAL ROUTE DUE TO LESIONS IN MORE POSTERIOR TEMPORAL STRUCTURES OF THE LEFT HEMISPHERE . PATIENTS CAN READ FAMILIAR REGULAR AND IRREGULAR WORDS BY MAKING USE OF STORED INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEANING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PARTICULAR VISUAL FORM ( SO THERE IS NO REGULARITY EFFECT LIKE IN SURFACE ALEXIA ) . HOWEVER THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS UNKNOWN WORDS OR NON-WORDS SINCE THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THE DIRECT ROUTE ( SEE 1.3 )</pattern>
<template>In contrast, phonological alexia is characterised by a disruption in the phonological route due to lesions in more posterior temporal structures of the left hemisphere. Patients can read familiar regular and irregular words by making use of stored information about the meaning associated with that particular visual form (so there is no regularity effect like in surface alexia). However, they are unable to process unknown words or non-words, since they have to rely on the direct route (see 1.3).</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>FURTHERMORE THE WOULD-BE PRONUNCIATION OF A WORD IS REFLECTED IN READING-COMPREHENSION ERRORS . WHEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE MEANING OF THE WORD “ BEAR ” PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SURFACE ALEXIA WOULD ANSWER SOMETHING LIKE “ A BEVERAGE ” BECAUSE THE RESULTING SOUND PATTERN OF “ BEAR ” WAS THE SAME FOR THESE PEOPLE AS THAT FOR “ BEER ” . THIS CHARACTERISTIC GOES ALONG WITH A TENDENCY TO CONFUSE HOMOPHONES ( WORDS THAT SOUND THE SAME BUT ARE SPELLED DIFFERENTLY AND HAVE DIFFERENT MEANINGS ASSOCIATED ) . HOWEVER THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL ABLE TO READ NON-WORDS WITH A REGULAR SPELLING SINCE THEY CAN APPLY GRAPHEME-TO-PHONEME RULES TO THEM</pattern>
<template>Furthermore, the would-be pronunciation of a word is reflected in reading-comprehension errors. When asked to describe the meaning of the word “bear”, people suffering from surface alexia would answer something like “a beverage” because the resulting sound pattern of “bear” was the same for these people as that for “beer”. This characteristic goes along with a tendency to confuse homophones (words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings associated). However, these people are still able to read non-words with a regular spelling since they can apply grapheme-to-phoneme rules to them.</template>

THESE WORDS ARE PRONOUNCED ACCORDING TO GRAPHEME-TO-PHONEME RULES ALTHOUGH HIGH-FREQUENCY IRREGULARLY SPELLED WORDS MAY BE PRESERVED IN SOME CASES THE PRONUNCIATION ACCORDING TO THE PHONOLOGICAL ROUTE IS JUST WRONG</pattern>
<template>Patients with a lesion in temporal structures of the left hemisphere (the exact location varies) suffer from so called surface alexia. They show the following characteristic symptoms that suggest a strong reliance on the phonological route: 
Very common are regularity effects, that is a mispronunciation of words in which the spelling is irregular like "colonel" or "yacht" (see 1.2).

THIS INTERMEDIATE STEP TAKES PLACES WHEN WE ARE MAKING USE OF GRAPHEME-TO-PHONEME RULES . GRAPHEME-TO-PHONEME RULES ARE A WAY OF DETERMINING THE PHONOLOGICAL REPRESENTATION FOR A GIVEN GRAPHEME . A GRAPHEME IS THE SMALLEST WRITTEN UNIT OF A WORD ( E.G . “ SH ” IN “ SHORE ” ) THAT REPRESENTS A PHONEME . A PHONEME ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE SMALLEST PHONOLOGICAL UNIT OF A WORD DISTINGUISHING IT FROM ANOTHER WORD THAT OTHERWISE SOUNDS THE SAME ( E.G . “ BAT ” AND “ CAT ” ) . PEOPLE LEARNING TO READ OR ARE ENCOUNTERING NEW WORDS OFTEN USE THE PHONOLOGICAL ROUTE TO ARRIVE AT A MEANING REPRESENTATION . THEY CONSTRUCT PHONEMES FOR EACH GRAPHEME AND THEN COMBINE THE INDIVIDUAL PHONEMES TO A SOUND PATTERN THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN MEANING ( SEE 1.1 )</pattern>
<template>Using the phonological route means having an intermediate step between perceiving and comprehending of written language. This intermediate step takes places when we are making use of grapheme-to-phoneme rules. Grapheme-to-phoneme rules are a way of determining the phonological representation for a given grapheme. A grapheme is the smallest written unit of a word (e.g. “sh” in “shore”) that represents a phoneme. A phoneme on the other hand is the smallest phonological unit of a word distinguishing it from another word that otherwise sounds the same (e.g. “bat” and “cat”). People learning to read or are encountering new words often use the phonological route to arrive at a meaning representation. They construct phonemes for each grapheme and then combine the individual phonemes to a sound pattern that is associated with a certain meaning (see 1.1).</template>

Those regions were known to cause conduction aphasia when damaged. But when the words were new ones, and/or the subjects never had to do a task like this before, the activation was recorded more posterior. That means, when you repeat an unexpected word, the heaviest working brain tissue is about somewhere under your upper left earlap, but when you knew this word that would be the next to repeat before, it is a bit nearer to your left eye.</template>

<template>PET studies (Fiez & Petersen, 1993, as cited in Banich, p. 295) have shown that in fact both anterior and posterior regions were activated in language comprehension and processing, but with different strengths – in agreement with the lesion studies. The more active speech production is required in experiments, the more frontal is the main activation: For example, when the presented words must be repeated.</template>

<pattern>GENERALLY IMAGING SHOWS THAT CERTAIN FUNCTIONAL BRAIN REGIONS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN ESTIMATED IN BRAIN LESION STUDIES AND THAT THEIR BOUNDARIES ARE MORE DISTINCT ( CF . BANICH P .   294 ) . THE EXACT LOCATION VARIES INDIVIDUALLY THEREFORE BRINGING THE RESULTS OF MANY BRAIN LESION STUDIES TOGETHER CAUSED TOO BIG ESTIMATED FUNCTIONAL REGIONS BEFORE .

<template>Generally, imaging shows that certain functional brain regions are much smaller than estimated in brain lesion studies, and that their boundaries are more distinct (cf. Banich p. 294). The exact location varies individually, therefore bringing the results of many brain lesion studies together caused too big estimated functional regions before. For example, stimulating brain tissue electrically (during epilepsy surgery) and observing the outcome (e.g. errors in naming tasks) led to a much better knowledge where language processing areas are located.</template>

<pattern>SEMANTICS DEALS WITH THE MEANING OF WORDS AND SENTENCES . IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM POSTERIOR APHASIA HAVE SEVERE PROBLEMS UNDERSTANDING SIMPLE TEXTS ALTHOUGH THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF SYNTAX IS INTACT . THE SEMANTIC SHORTCOMING IS OFTEN EXAMINED BY A TOKEN TEST A TEST IN WHICH PATIENTS HAVE TO POINT TO OBJECTS REFERRED TO IN SIMPLE SENTENCES .

<template>Semantics deals with the meaning of words and sentences. 
It has been shown that patients suffering from posterior aphasia have severe problems understanding simple texts, although their knowledge of syntax is intact. The semantic shortcoming is often examined by a Token Test, a test in which patients have to point to objects referred to in simple sentences. As might have been guessed, people with anterior aphasia have no problems with semantics, yet they might not be able to understand longer sentences because the knowledge of syntax then is involved as well.</template>

<pattern>RESULTS SHOW THAT IN FLUENT AS WELL AS IN NON-FLUENT APHASIA PATIENTS USUALLY MIX UP ONLY ONE DISTINCTIVE FEATURE NOT TWO . IN GENERAL IT CAN BE SAID THAT ERRORS CONNECTED TO THE PLACE OF ARTICULATION ARE MORE COMMON THAN THOSE LINKED TO VOICING . INTERESTINGLY SOME APHASIA PATIENTS ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES OF TWO PHONEMES YET THEY ARE UNABLE TO PRODUCE THE RIGHT SOUND . THIS SUGGESTS THAT THOUGH PATIENTS HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY PRONOUNCING WORDS CORRECTLY THEIR COMPREHENSION OF WORDS IS STILL QUITE GOOD . THIS IS CHARACTERISTIC FOR PATIENTS WITH BROCA S APHASIA WHILE THOSE WITH WERNICKE S APHASIA SHOW CONTRARY SYMPTOMS : THEY ARE ABLE TO PRONOUNCE WORDS CORRECTLY BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORDS MEAN . THAT IS WHY THEY OFTEN UTTER PHONOLOGICALLY CORRECT WORDS ( NEOLOGISMS ) THAT ARE NOT REAL WORDS WITH A MEANING</pattern>
<template>Results show that in fluent as well as in non-fluent aphasia patients usually mix up only one distinctive feature, not two. In general it can be said that errors connected to the place of articulation are more common than those linked to voicing. Interestingly some aphasia patients are well aware of the different features of two phonemes, yet they are unable to produce the right sound. This suggests that though patients have great difficulty pronouncing words correctly, their comprehension of words is still quite good. This is characteristic for patients with Broca`s aphasia, while those with Wernicke`s aphasia show contrary symptoms: they are able to pronounce words correctly, but cannot understand what the words mean. That is why they often utter phonologically correct words (neologisms) that are not real words with a meaning.</template>

<pattern>EXAMINING WHICH PARTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PHONETIC REPRESENTATION PATIENTS WITH BROCA S OR WERNICKE S APHASIA CAN BE COMPARED . AS THE SPEECH CHARACTERISTIC FOR PATIENTS WITH BROCA S APHASIA IS NON-FLUENT I.E . THEY HAVE PROBLEMS PRODUCING THE CORRECT PHONETIC AND PHONEMIC REPRESENTATION OF A SOUND AND PEOPLE WITH WERNICKE S APHASIA DO NOT SHOW ANY PROBLEMS SPEAKING FLUENTLY BUT ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS PRODUCING THE RIGHT PHONEME . THIS INDICATES THAT BROCA S AREA IS MAINLY INVOLVED IN PHONOLOGICAL PRODUCTION AND ALSO THAT PHONEMIC AND PHONETIC REPRESENTATION DO NOT TAKE PLACE IN THE SAME PART OF THE BRAIN . SCIENTISTS EXAMINED ON A MORE PRECISE LEVEL THE SPEECH PRODUCTION ON THE LEVEL OF THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF PHONEMES TO SEE IN WHICH FEATURES PATIENTS WITH APHASIA MADE MISTAKES</pattern>
<template>Examining which parts are responsible for phonetic representation, patients with Broca`s or Wernicke`s aphasia can be compared. As the speech characteristic for patients with Broca`s aphasia is non-fluent, i.e. they have problems producing the correct phonetic and phonemic representation of a sound, and people with Wernicke`s aphasia do not show any problems speaking fluently, but also have problems producing the right phoneme. This indicates that Broca`s area is mainly involved in phonological production and also, that phonemic and phonetic representation do not take place in the same part of the brain. Scientists examined on a more precise level the speech production, on the level of the distinctive features of phonemes, to see in which features patients with aphasia made mistakes.</template>

<template>Phonology deals with the processing of meaningful parts of speech resulting from the mere sound. More over there exists a differentiation between a phonemic representation of a speech sound which are the smallest units of sounds that leads to different meanings (e.g. the /b/ and /p/ in bet and pat) and phonetic representation. The latter means that a speech sound may be produced in a different manner at different situations. For instance the /p/ in pill sounds different than the /p/ in spill since the former /p/ is aspirated and the latter is not.</template>

INDEED PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM THIS KIND OF APHASIA SHOW AN INABILITY TO REPRODUCE SENTENCES SINCE THEY OFTEN MAKE PHONEMIC PARAPHASIAS MAY SUBSTITUTE OR LEAVE OUT WORDS OR MIGHT SAY NOTHING . INVESTIGATIONS DETERMINED THAT THE CONNECTION CABLE NAMELY THE ARCUATE FASCICULUS BETWEEN WERNICKE ‘ S AND BROCA ‘ S AREA IS ALMOST INVARIABLY DAMAGED IN CASE OF A CONDUCTION APHASIA . THAT IS WHY CONDUCTION APHASIA IS ALSO REGARDED AS A DISCONNECTION SYNDROME ( THE BEHAVIOURAL DYSFUNCTION BECAUSE OF A DAMAGE TO THE CONNECTION OF TWO CONNECTED BRAIN REGIONS )</pattern>
<template>Wernicke supposed that an aphasia between Broca‘s area and Wernicke‘s area, namely conduction aphasia, would lead to severe problems to repeat just heard sentences rather than having problems with the comprehension and production of speech. Indeed patients suffering from this kind of aphasia show an inability to reproduce sentences since they often make phonemic paraphasias, may substitute or leave out words, or might say nothing. Investigations determined that the "connection cable", namely the arcuate fasciculus between Wernicke‘s and Broca‘s area is almost invariably damaged in case of a conduction aphasia. That is why conduction aphasia is also regarded as a disconnection syndrome (the behavioural dysfunction because of a damage to the connection of two connected brain regions).</template>

BECAUSE THESE SYMPTOMS DO NOT RESULT FROM MOTORIC PROBLEMS OF THE VOCAL MUSCULATURE A REGION IN THE BRAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LINGUISTIC OUTPUT MUST BE LESIONED . BROCA DISCOVERED THAT THE BRAIN REGION CAUSING FLUENT SPEECH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LINGUISTIC OUTPUT MUST BE LOCATED VENTRALLY IN THE FRONTAL LOBE ANTERIOR TO THE MOTOR STRIP . RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTED THAT BROCA S APHASIA RESULTS ALSO FROM SUBCORTICAL TISSUE AND WHITE MATTER AND NOT ONLY CORTICAL TISSUE</pattern>
<template>One of the most well-known aphasias is Broca’s aphasia that causes patients to be unable to speak fluently. Moreover they have a great difficulty producing words. Comprehension, however, is relatively intact in those patients. Because these symptoms do not result from motoric problems of the vocal musculature, a region in the brain that is responsible for linguistic output must be lesioned. Broca discovered that the brain region causing fluent speech is responsible for linguistic output, must be located ventrally in the frontal lobe, anterior to the motor strip. Recent research suggested that Broca`s aphasia results also from subcortical tissue and white matter and not only cortical tissue.</template>

<template>Not only cases of left-handers but also brain imaging techniques have shown examples of bilateral language processing: According to ERP studies (by Bellugi et al. 1994 and Neville et al. 1993 as cited in E. Dabrowska, "Language, Mind an Brain" 2004, p. 57), people with the Williams’ syndrome (WS) also have no dominant hemisphere for language. WS patients have a lot of physical and mental disorders, but show, compared to their other (poor) cognitive abilities, very good linguistic skills. And these skills do not rely on one dominant hemisphere, but both of them contribute equally. So, whilst the majority of the population has a dominant left hemisphere for language processing there are a variety of exceptions to that dominance. That there are different “organisation possibilities” in individual brains Dabrowska (p. 57) suggests that the organisational structure in the brain could be less innate and fixed as it is commonly thought.</template>

<pattern>TWO THEORIES WHY THE LEFT HEMISPHERE MIGHT HAVE SPECIAL LANGUAGE CAPACITIES ARE STILL DISCUSSED . THE FIRST STATES THAT DOMINANCE OF THE LEFT HEMISPHERE IS DUE TO A SPECIALIZATION FOR PRECISE TEMPORAL CONTROL OF ORAL AND MANUAL ARTICULATORS . HERE THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT GESTURES RELATED TO A STORY LINE ARE MOST OFTEN MADE WITH THE RIGHT AND THEREFORE BY THE LEFT HEMISPHERE CONTROLLED HAND WHILST OTHER HAND MOVEMENTS APPEAR EQUALLY OFTEN WITH BOTH HANDS . THE OTHER THEORY SAYS THAT THE LEFT HEMISPHERE IS DOMINANT BECAUSE IT IS SPECIALIZED FOR LINGUISTIC PROCESSING AND IS DUE TO A SINGLE PATIENT - A SPEAKER OF AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE WITH A LEFT HEMISPHERE LESION . HE COULD NEITHER PRODUCE NOR COMPREHEND ASL BUT COULD STILL COMMUNICATE BY USING GESTURES IN NON-LINGUISTIC DOMAINS</pattern>
<template>Two theories why the left hemisphere might have special language capacities are still discussed. The first states that dominance of the left hemisphere is due to a specialization for precise temporal control of oral and manual articulators. Here the main argument is that gestures related to a story line are most often made with the right and therefore by the left hemisphere controlled hand whilst other hand movements appear equally often with both hands. The other theory says that the left hemisphere is dominant because it is specialized for linguistic processing and is due to a single patient - a speaker of American Sign Language with a left hemisphere lesion. He could neither produce nor comprehend ASL, but could still communicate by using gestures in non-linguistic domains.</template>

<pattern>REASON TO BELIEF THAT RECOGNITION OF PROSODIC PATTERNS APPEARS IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE ARISES WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PATIENTS THAT HAVE DAMAGE TO AN ANTERIOR REGION OF THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE .

<template>Reason to belief that recognition of prosodic patterns appears in the right hemisphere arises when you take into account patients that have damage to an anterior region of the right hemisphere. They suffer from aprosodic speech, that is, their utterances are all at the same pitch. They might sound like a robot from the 80ties. There is another phenomena appearing from brain damage: dysprosodic speech. In that case the patient speaks with disordered intonation. This is not due to a right hemisphere lesion, but arises when damage to the left hemisphere is suffered. The explanation is that the left hemisphere gives ill-timed prosodic cues to the right hemisphere, thus proper intonation is affected.</template>

<template>After, for example, damage occurs to the left hemisphere, it follows that there is a visuospatial deficit, which is usually more severe in left-handers than in right-handers. Dissimilarities may derive, in part, from differences in brain morphology, which concludes from asymmetries in the planum temporale. Still, it can be assumed that left-handers have less division of labour between their two hemispheres than right-handers do and are more likely to lack neuroanatomical asymmetries.</template>

<template>In right handers, verbal processing is mostly done in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Therefore, 95% of speech output is controlled by the left brain hemisphere, whereas only 5% of individuals control speech output in their right hemisphere. Left-handers, on the other hand, have a heterogeneous brain organization. Their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right handers, the opposite way, or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. But usually, in 70% of the cases, speech is controlled by the left-hemisphere, 15% by the right and 15% by either hemisphere. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it appears that left-handers are less lateralized.</template>

<pattern>ONE MOST COMMONLY ACCEPTED IDEA AS TO HOW HANDEDNESS AFFECTS THE HEMISPHERES IS THE BRAIN HEMISPHERE DIVISION OF LABOUR .

SINCE IN MOST PEOPLE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BRAIN CONTROLS SPEAKING RIGHT-HANDEDNESS PREDOMINATES . THE THEORY ALSO PREDICTS THAT LEFT-HANDED PEOPLE HAVE A REVERSED BRAIN DIVISION OF LABOUR</pattern>
<template>One most commonly accepted idea, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labour. Since both speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, the presumption here is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. The theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labour.</template>

<template>These outcomes are clear evidence of the human brain’s functional asymmetry. The left hemisphere seems to dominate functions of speech and language processing, but is unable to handle spatial tasks like vision-independent object recognition. The right hemisphere seems to dominate spatial functions, but is unable to process words and meaning independently. In a second experiment evidence arose that a split-brain patient can only follow a written command (like "get up now!"), if it is presented to the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere can only "understand" pictorial instructions.</template>

CONTRARILY THE PARTICIPANT IS UNABLE TO NAME THE DIE IF IT WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE BUT EASILY PICKS IT OUT OF THE HEAP OF OBJECTS ON THE TABLE WITH THE HELP OF THE LEFT HAND</pattern>
<template>It can be shown that a picture, for example the drawing of a die, which has only been presented to the left hemisphere, can be named by the participant ("I saw a die"), but is not selectable with the right hand (no idea which object to choose from the table). Contrarily the participant is unable to name the die, if it was recognized in the right hemisphere, but easily picks it out of the heap of objects on the table with the help of the left hand.</template>

<template>Initially we will consider the most apparent part of a differentiation between left and right hemisphere: Their differences in shape and structure. As visible to the naked eye there exists a clear asymmetry between the two halves of the human brain: The right hemisphere typically has a bigger, wider and farther extended frontal region than the left hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is bigger, wider and extends farther in it’s occipital region (M. T. Banich,"Neuropsychology", ch.3, pg.92). Significantly larger on the left side in most human brains is a certain part of the temporal lobe’s surface, which is called the planum temporale. It is localized near Wernicke’s area and other auditory association areas, wherefore we can already speculate that the left hemisphere might be stronger involved in processes of language and speech treatment.</template>

<template>The result of Roberson's experiment was that it is easier for British people to discriminate between green and blue whereas Berinmos have less difficulties distinguishing between Nol and Wap. The reaction to colour is affected by language, by the vocabulary we have for denoting colours. It is difficult for people to distinguish colours from the same colour category but people have less trouble differentiating between colours from different categories. Both groups have categorical colour perception but the results for naming colours depends on how the colour categories were named.

<pattern>APART FROM EXPERIMENTS WHICH SHOW HOW SYNTAX IS USED FOR PARSING SENTENCES THERE WERE ALSO EXPERIMENS ON HOW SEMANTICS CAN INFLUENCE THE SENTENCE PROCESSING . ONE IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT ABOUT THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN DONE BY DANIEL SLOBIN IN 1966 . HE SHOWED THAT PASSIVE SENTENCES ARE UNDERSTOOD FASTER IF THE SEMANTICS OF THE WORDS ALLOW ONLY ONE SUBJECT TO BE THE ACTOR . SENTENCES LIKE “ THE HORSE WAS KICKED BY THE COW . ” AND “ THE FENCE WAS KICKED BY THE COW . ” ARE GRAMMATICALLY EQUAL AND IN BOTH CASES ONLY ONE SYNTACTICAL PARSING IS POSSIBLE . NEVERTHELESS THE FIRST SENTENCE SEMANTICALLY PROVIDES TWO SUBJECTS AS POSSIBLE ACTORS AND THEREFORE IT NEEDS LONGER TO PARSE THIS SENTENCE . BY MEASURING THIS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE DANIEL SLOBIN SHOWED THAT SEMANTICS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PARSING A SENTENCE TOO</pattern>
<template>Apart from experiments which show how syntax is used for parsing sentences there were also experimens on how semantics can influence the sentence processing. One important experiment about that issue has been done by Daniel Slobin in 1966. He showed that passive sentences are understood faster if the semantics of the words allow only one subject to be the actor. Sentences like “The horse was kicked by the cow.” and “The fence was kicked by the cow.” are grammatically equal and in both cases only one syntactical parsing is possible. Nevertheless the first sentence semantically provides two subjects as possible actors and therefore it needs longer to parse this sentence. By measuring this significant difference Daniel Slobin showed that semantics play an important role in parsing a sentence, too.</template>

<pattern>BEHAVIORISTIC EXPERIMENTS ABOUT HOW HUMAN BEINGS PARSE A SENTENCE OFTEN USE SYNTACTICALLY AMBIGUOUS SENTENCES . BECAUSE IT IS EASIER TO REALIZE THAT SENTENCE-ANALYSING MECHANISMS CALLED PARSING TAKE PLACE WHEN USING SENTENCES IN WHICH WE CANNOT AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTE THE MEANING OF THE SENTENCE . THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THEORIES ABOUT HOW HUMANS PARSE SENTENCES . THE SYNTAX-FIRST APPROACH CLAIMS THAT SYNTAX PLAYS THE MAIN PART WHEREAS SEMANTICS HAS ONLY A SUPPORTING ROLE WHEREAS THE INTERACTIONIST APPROACH STATES THAT BOTH SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS WORK TOGETHER TO DETERMINE THE MEANING OF A SENTENCE . BOTH THEORIES WILL BE EXPLAINED BELOW IN MORE DETAIL</pattern>

<li>Behavioristic experiments about how human beings parse a sentence often use syntactically ambiguous sentences. Because it is easier to realize that sentence-analysing mechanisms called parsing take place when using sentences in which we cannot automatically constitute the meaning of the sentence. There are two different theories about how humans parse sentences. The syntax-first approach claims that syntax plays the main part whereas semantics has only a supporting role, whereas the interactionist approach states that both syntax and semantics work together to determine the meaning of a sentence. Both theories will be explained below in more detail.</li>

<pattern>TO SUMMARIZE THE THREE IMPORTANT ERP-COMPONENTS : FIRST OF ALL THERE OCCURS THE ELAN AT THE LEFT FRONTAL LOBE WHICH SHOWS A VIOLATION OF SYNTACTICAL RULES . AFTER IT FOLLOWS THE N400 IN CENTRAL AND PARTIAL AREAS AS A REACTION TO A SEMANTICAL INCORRECTNESS AND FINALLY THERE OCCURS A P600 IN THE PARTIAL AREA WHICH PROBABLY MEANS A REANALYSIS OF THE WRONG SENTENCE</pattern>
<template>To summarize the three important ERP-components: First of all there occurs the ELAN at the left frontal lobe which shows a violation of syntactical rules. After it follows the N400 in central and partial areas as a reaction to a semantical incorrectness and finally there occurs a P600 in the partial area which probably means a reanalysis of the wrong sentence.</template>

<pattern>THE OTHER CHANGE IN THE ERP WHEN PERCEIVING A SYNTACTICAL WRONG SENTENCE OCCURS AFTER 600MS IN THE PARTIAL LOBE . THE SIGNAL IS INCREASING POSITIVELY AND IS THEREFORE CALLED P600 . POSSIBLY THE LATE POSITIVE SIGNAL IS REFLECTING THE ATTEMPT TO RECONSTRUCT THE GRAMMATICAL PROBLEMATIC SENTENCE TO FIND A POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION .

<template>The other change in the ERP when perceiving a syntactical wrong sentence occurs after 600ms in the partial lobe. The signal is increasing positively and is therefore called P600. Possibly the late positive signal is reflecting the attempt to reconstruct the grammatical problematic sentence to find a possible interpretation.

<pattern>TO EXAMINE THE SYNTACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE SENTENCE PROCESSING A QUITE SIMILAR EXPERIMENT AS IN THE CASE OF THE SEMANTIC PROCESSING WAS DONE . THERE WERE USED SYNTACTICAL CORRECT SENTENCES AND INCORRECT SENTENCES SUCH AS ( CORRECT : ) “ THE CATS WON ´ T EAT … ” AND ( INCORRECT : ) “ THE CATS WON ´ T EATING … ” . WHEN HEARING OR READING A SYNTACTICAL INCORRECT SENTENCE IN CONTRAST TO A SYNTACTICAL CORRECT SENTENCE THE ERP CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY ON TWO DIFFERENT POINTS OF TIME . FIRST OF ALL THERE A VERY EARLY INCREASED RESPONSE TO SYNTACTICAL INCORRECTNESS AFTER 120MS . THIS SIGNAL IS CALLED THE ‘ EARLY LEFT ANTERIOR NEGATIVITY ’ BECAUSE IT OCCURS MAINLY IN THE LEFT FRONTAL LOBE . THIS ADVISES THAT THE SYNTACTICAL PROCESSING IS LOCATED AMONGST OTHERS IN BROCA S AREA WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE LEFT FRONTAL LOBE . THE EARLY RESPONSE TO SYNTACTICAL MISTAKES ALSO INDICATES THAT THE SYNTACTICAL MISTAKES ARE DETECTED EARLIER THAN SEMANTIC MISTAKES</pattern>
<template>To examine the syntactical aspects of the sentence processing a quite similar experiment as in the case of the semantic processing was done. There were used syntactical correct sentences and incorrect sentences, such as (correct:)“The cats won´t eat…” and (incorrect:)“The cats won´t eating…”. When hearing or reading a syntactical incorrect sentence in contrast to a syntactical correct sentence the ERP changes significantly on two different points of time. First of all there a very early increased response to syntactical incorrectness after 120ms. This signal is called the ‘early left anterior negativity’ because it occurs mainly in the left frontal lobe. This advises that the syntactical processing is located amongst others in Broca's area which is located in the left frontal lobe. The early response to syntactical mistakes also indicates that the syntactical mistakes are detected earlier than semantic mistakes.</template>

<category>
<pattern>IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS THE ERP EVOKED BY THE CORRECT SENTENCE IS CONSIDERED TO SHOW THE ORDINARY SENTENCE PROCESSING . THE VARIATIONS IN THE ERP IN CASE OF THE INCORRECT SENTENCES IN CONTRAST TO THE ERP OF THE CORRECT SENTENCE SHOW AT WHAT TIME THE MISTAKE IS RECOGNIZED . IN CASE OF SEMANTIC INCORRECTNESS THERE WAS OBSERVED A STRONG NEGATIVE SIGNAL ABOUT 400MS AFTER PERCEIVING THE CRITICAL WORD WHICH DID NOT OCCURE IF THE SENTENCE WAS SEMANTICALLY CORRECT . THESE EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED MAINLY IN THE PARTIAL AND CENTRAL AREA . THERE WAS ALSO FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE N400 IS THE STRONGER THE LESS THE WORD FITS SEMANTICALLY . THE WORD “ DRINK ” WHICH FITS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE CONTEXT CAUSED A WEAKER N400 THAN THE WORD “ CRY ” . THAT MEANS THE INTENSITY OF THE N400 CORRELATES WITH THE DEGREE OF THE SEMANTIC MISTAKE . THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO SEARCH FOR A SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION OF A SENTENCE THE HIGHER IS THE N400 RESPONSE</pattern>
<template>In such experiments the ERP evoked by the correct sentence is considered to show the ordinary sentence processing. The variations in the ERP in case of the incorrect sentences in contrast to the ERP of the correct sentence show at what time the mistake is recognized. In case of semantic incorrectness there was observed a strong negative signal about 400ms after perceiving the critical word which did not occure, if the sentence was semantically correct. These effects were observed mainly in the partial and central area. There was also found evidence that the N400 is the stronger the less the word fits semantically. The word “drink” which fits a little bit more in the context caused a weaker N400 than the word “cry”. That means the intensity of the N400 correlates with the degree of the semantic mistake. The more difficult it is to search for a semantic interpretation of a sentence the higher is the N400 response.</template>

<pattern>IN THIS AREA OF RESEARCH THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHER UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHY WE CANNOT IMAGINE SMELL HOW THE RECALL PROCESSES ARE PERFORMED OR WHERE THE STORAGE OF IMAGES IS LOCATED . THE IMAGERY DEBATE IS STILL GOING ON AND ULTIMATE EVIDENCE SHOWING WHICH OF THE MODELS EXPLAINS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN IMAGERY AND MEMORY ARE MISSING . FOR NOW THE DUAL-CODE THEORY SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PROMISING MODEL</pattern>
<template>In this area of research, there are of course other unanswered questions, for example
why we cannot imagine smell, how the recall processes are performed or where
the storage of images is located. The imagery debate is still going on, and ultimate
evidence showing which of the models explains the connection between imagery and
memory are missing. For now the dual-code theory seems to be the most promising
model.</template>

<pattern>UNLIKE THE COMMON-CODE AND ABSTRACT-PROPOSITIONAL APPROACHES THIS MODEL POSTULATES THAT WORDS AND IMAGES ARE REPRESENTED IN FUNCTIONALLY DISTINCT VERBAL AND NON - VERBAL MEMORY SYSTEMS . TO ESTABLISH THIS MODEL ROLAND AND FRIDBERG ( 1985 ) HAD RUN AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH THE SUBJECTS HAD EITHER TO IMAGINE A MNEMONIC OR HOW THEY WALK THE WAY TO THEIR HOME THROUGH THEIR NEIGHBOURHOODS . WHILE THE SUBJECTS DID ONE OF THIS TASKS THEIR BRAIN WAS SCANNED WITH THE POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY ( PET ) . FIGURE 10 IS A PICTURE COMBINING THE BRAINS OF THE SUBJECTS WHICH ACHIEVED THE FIRST AND THE SECOND TASK</pattern>
<template>Unlike the common-code and abstract-propositional approaches, this model postulates that words and images are represented in functionally distinct verbal and non - verbal memory systems. To establish this model, Roland and Fridberg (1985) had run an experiment, in which the subjects had either to imagine a mnemonic or how they walk the way to
their home through their neighbourhoods. While the subjects did one of this tasks,
their brain was scanned with the positron emission tomography (PET). Figure 10
is a picture combining the brains of the subjects, which achieved the first and the
second task.</template>

<pattern>BESIDES THE IMAGERY DEBATE WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTION HOW WE IMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE OBJECTS PERSONS SITUATIONS AND INVOLVE OUR SENSES IN THESE MENTAL PICTURES QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE MEMORY ARE STILL UNTREATED . IN THIS PART OF THE CHAPTER ABOUT IMAGERY WE ARE DEALING WITH THE QUESTIONS HOW IMAGES ARE ENCODED IN THE BRAIN AND HOW THEY ARE RECALLED OUT OF OUR MEMORY . IN SEARCH OF ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS THREE MAJOR THEORIES EVOLVED . ALL OF THEM EXPLAIN THE ENCODING AND RECALLING PROCESSES DIFFERENT AND AS USUAL VALIDATING EXPERIMENTS WERE REALISED FOR ALL THESE THEORIES</pattern>
<template>Besides the imagery debate, which is concerned with the question how we imagine
for example objects, persons, situations and involve our senses in these mental
pictures, questions concerning the memory are still untreated. In this part of the chapter about imagery we are dealing with the questions how images are encoded in the brain, and how they are recalled out of our memory.
In search of answering these questions three major theories evolved. All of them
explain the encoding and recalling processes different, and as usual validating experiments were realised for all these theories.</template>

<pattern>AS DOUBLE DISSOCIATION USUALLY SUGGESTS THAT TWO FUNCTIONS RELY ON DIFFERENT BRAIN REGIONS OR PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THE DESCRIBED EXAMPLES IMPLY THAT IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION DO NOT SHARE EXACTLY THE SAME PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS . THIS OF COURSE CONFLICTS WITH THE EVIDENCE FROM BRAIN IMAGING MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER CASES OF PATIENTS WITH BRAIN DAMAGE MENTIONED ABOVE THAT SHOWED A CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION</pattern>
<template>As double dissociation usually suggests that two functions rely on different brain
regions or physiological mechanisms, the described examples imply that imagery
and perception do not share exactly the same physiological mechanisms. This of
course conflicts with the evidence from brain imaging measurements and other cases
of patients with brain damage mentioned above that showed a close connection
between imagery and perception.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>THE IDEA THAT MENTAL IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION SHARE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IS THUS SUPPORTED BY BOTH BRAIN IMAGING EXPERIMENTS WITH NORMAL PARTICIPANTS AND EFFECTS OF BRAIN DAMAGE LIKE IN PATIENTS WITH UNILATERAL NEGLECT . HOWEVER ALSO CONTRADICTORY RESULTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED INDICATING THAT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF PERCEPTION AND IMAGERY CANNOT BE IDENTICAL</pattern>
<template>The idea that mental imagery and perception share physiological mechanisms
is thus supported by both brain imaging experiments with normal participants and
effects of brain damage like in patients with unilateral neglect. However, also contradictory 
results have been observed, indicating that the underlying mechanisms of                                                                                perception and imagery cannot be identical.</template>
</category>
<category>
<pattern>ANOTHER APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND IMAGERY HAS BEEN MADE BY STUDIES OF PEOPLE WITH BRAIN DAMAGE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF BOTH IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION ARE AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY . OFTEN PATIENTS WITH PERCEPTUAL PROBLEMS ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS IN CREATING IMAGES LIKE IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE HAVING BOTH LOST THE ABILITY TO SEE COLOUR AND TO CREATE COLOURS THROUGH IMAGERY . ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT OF A PATIENT WITH UNILATERAL NEGLECT WHICH IS DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE PARIETAL LOBES AND CAUSES THAT THE PATIENT IGNORES OBJECTS IN ONE HALF OF HIS VISUAL FIELD . BY ASKING THE PATIENT TO IMAGINE HIMSELF STANDING AT A PLACE THAT IS FAMILIAR TO HIM AND TO DESCRIBE THE THINGS HE IS SEEING IT WAS FOUND OUT THAT HE DID NOT ONLY NEGLECT THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS PERCEPTIONS BUT ALSO THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS MENTAL IMAGES AS HE COULD ONLY NAME OBJECTS THAT WERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF HIS MENTAL IMAGE</pattern>
<template>Another approach to understand imagery has been made by studies of people
with brain damage in order to determine if both imagery and perception are affected
in the same way. Often, patients with perceptual problems also have problems in
creating images like in the case of people having both lost the ability to see colour
and to create colours through imagery. Another example is that of a patient with
unilateral neglect, which is due to damage to the parietal lobes and causes that
the patient ignores objects in one half of his visual field. By asking the patient to
imagine himself standing at a place that is familiar to him and to describe the
things he is seeing, it was found out that he did not only neglect the left side of
his perceptions but also the left side of his mental images, as he could only name 
objects that were on the right hand side of his mental image.</template>

<pattern>BRAIN IMAGING EXPERIMENTS IN THE 1990S CONFIRMED THE RESULTS WHICH PREVIOUS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS HAD ALREADY MADE . THEREIN BRAIN ACTIVITY OF PARTICIPANTS WAS MEASURED USING EITHER PET OR FMRI BOTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATING VISUAL IMAGES AND WHEN THEY WERE NOT CREATING IMAGES . THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT IMAGERY CREATES ACTIVITY IN THE STRIATE CORTEX WHICH IS BEING THE PRIMARY VISUAL RECEIVING AREA ALSO ACTIVE DURING VISUAL PERCEPTION . FIGURE 8 ( NOT INCLUDED YET DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES ) SHOWS HOW ACTIVITY IN THE STRIATE CORTEX INCREASED BOTH WHEN A PERSON PERCEIVED AN OBJECT ( “ STIMULUS ON ” ) AND WHEN THE PERSON CREATED A VISUAL IMAGE OF IT ( “ IMAGINED STIMULUS ” ) . ALTHOUGH THE STRIATE CORTEX HAS NOT BECOME ACTIVATED BY IMAGERY IN ALL BRAIN-IMAGING STUDIES MOST RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS ACTIVATED WHEN PARTICIPANTS ARE ASKED TO CREATE DETAILED IMAGES</pattern>
<template>Brain imaging experiments in the 1990s confirmed the results which previous
electrophysiological measurements had already made. Therein brain activity of participants
was measured, using either PET or fMRI, both when they were creating
visual images and when they were not creating images. These experiments showed
that imagery creates activity in the striate cortex which is, being the primary visual
receiving area, also active during visual perception. Figure 8 (not included yet due to copyright issues) shows how activity in
the striate cortex increased both when a person perceived an object (“stimulus on”)
and when the person created a visual image of it (“imagined stimulus”). Although
the striate cortex has not become activated by imagery in all brain-imaging studies,
most results indicate that it is activated when participants are asked to create
detailed images.</template>

<pattern>WE WILL SEE THAT MANY RESULTS FROM NEUROSCIENCE SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED AND SHARE THE SAME PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS . NEVERTHELESS THE CONTRADICTORY PHENOMENA OF DOUBLE DISSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION SHOWS THAT THE OVERLAP IS NOT PERFECT . A THEORY THAT TRIES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL RESULTS AND GIVES AN EXPLANATION FOR THE DISSOCIATIONS WILL THEREFORE BE PRESENTED IN THE END OF THIS SECTION</pattern>
<template>We will see that many results from neuroscience support the theory that imagery
and perception are closely connected and share the same physiological mechanisms.
Nevertheless the contradictory phenomena of double dissociations between imagery
and perception shows that the overlap is not perfect. A theory that tries to take
into account all the neuropsychological results and gives an explanation for the
dissociations will therefore be presented in the end of this section.</template>

<pattern>VISUAL IMAGERY WAS INVESTIGATED BY PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES RELYING SOLELY ON BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE LATE 1980S . BY THAT TIME RESEARCH ON THE BRAIN BY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS THE EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL ( ERP ) AND BRAIN-IMAGING TECHNIQUES ( FMRI PET ) BECAME POSSIBLE . IT WAS THEREFORE HOPED THAT NEUROLOGICAL EVIDENCE HOW THE BRAIN RESPONDS TO VISUAL IMAGERY WOULD HELP TO RESOLVE THE IMAGERY DEBATE</pattern>
<template>Visual imagery was investigated by psychological studies relying solely on behavioural
experiments until the late 1980s. By that time, research on the brain by electrophysiological measurements such as the event-related potential (ERP) and brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, PET) became possible. It was therefore hoped that neurological evidence how the brain responds to visual imagery would help to resolve the imagery debate.</template>

<pattern>TO SUM IT UP IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT IMAGERY AND PERCEPTION SHARE CERTAIN FEATURES BUT ALSO DIFFERS IN SOME POINTS . FOR EXAMPLE PERCEPTION IS A BOTTOM-UP PROCESS THAT ORIGINATES WITH AN IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHEREAS IMAGERY IS A TOP-DOWN MECHANISM WHICH ORIGINATES WHEN ACTIVITY IS GENERATED IN HIGHER VISUAL CENTRES WITHOUT AN ACTUAL STIMULUS . ANOTHER DISTINCTION CAN BE MADE BY SAYING THAT PERCEPTION OCCURS AUTOMATICALLY AND REMAINS RELATIVELY STABLE WHEREAS IMAGERY NEEDS EFFORT AND IS FRAGILE . BUT AS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS FAILED TO POINT OUT ONE RIGHT THEORY NOW THE DEBATE IS TRANSLOCATED TO NEUROSCIENCE WHICH METHODS HAD PROMISING IMPROVEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE LAST THREE DECADES</pattern>
<template>To sum it up, it is commonly believed, that imagery and perception share certain features but also differs in some points. For example, perception is a bottom-up process that originates with an image on the retina, whereas imagery is a top-down mechanism which originates when activity is generated in higher visual centres without an actual stimulus. Another distinction can be made by saying that perception occurs automatically and remains relatively stable, whereas imagery needs effort and is fragile. But as psychological discussions failed to point out one right theory, now the debate is translocated to neuroscience, which methods had promising improvements throughout the last three decades.</template>

<template>Only four years later, Finke and Pinker published a counter model. Picture (1) shows a surface with four dots, which were presented to the subjects. After two seconds, it was replaced by picture (2), with an arrow on it. The subjects had to decide, if the arrow pointed at a former dot. The result was, that they reacted slower, if the arrow was farer away from a dot. Finke and Pinker concluded, that within two seconds, the distances can only be stored within a spatial representation of the surface.</template>

<pattern>ALTHOUGH MOST RESEARCH ON MENTAL MODELS HAS FOCUSSED ON TEXT COMPREHENSION RESEARCHERS GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT MENTAL MODELS ARE PERCEPTUALLY BASED . INDEED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FOUND TO USE SPATIAL FRAMEWORKS LIKE THOSE CREATED FOR TEXTS TO RETRIEVE SPATIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OBSERVED SCENES ( BRYANT 1991 ) . THUS PEOPLE CREATE THE SAME SORTS OF SPATIAL MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS NO MATTER IF THEY READ ABOUT AN ENVIRONMENT OR SEE IT THEMSELVES</pattern>
<template>Although most research on mental models has focussed on text comprehension, researchers generally believe that mental models are perceptually based. Indeed, people have been found to use spatial frameworks like those created for texts to retrieve spatial information about observed scenes (Bryant, 1991).

<pattern>TOGETHER WITH PAIVIO S MEMORY RESEARCH THIS EXPERIMENT WAS CRUCIAL FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF IMAGERY WITHIN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY BECAUSE IT SHOWED THE SIMILARITY OF IMAGERY TO THE PROCESSES OF PERCEPTION . FOR A MENTAL ROTATION OF 40 ° THE SUBJECTS NEEDED TWO SECONDS IN AVERAGE WHEREAS FOR A 140 ° ROTATION THE REACTION TIME INCREASED TO FOUR SECONDS . THEREFORE IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT PEOPLE IN GENERAL HAVE A MENTAL OBJECT ROTATION RATE OF 50 ° PER SECOND</pattern>
<template>Together with Paivio's memory research, this experiment was crucial for the importance of imagery within cognitive psychology, because it showed the similarity of imagery to the processes of perception.
For a mental rotation of 40° the subjects needed two seconds in average, whereas for a 140° rotation the reaction time increased to four seconds. Therefore, it can be concluded that people in general have a mental object rotation rate of 50° per second.</template>

<pattern>OTHER ADVOCATES OF THE SPATIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY SHEPARD AND METZLER DEVELOPED THE MENTAL ROTATION TASK IN 1971 .

<pattern>ANOTHER SEMINAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD WERE KOSSLYN S IMAGE-SCANNING EXPERIMENTS IN THE 1970S . REFERRING TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE MENTAL REPRESENTATION OF A SHIP HE EXPERIENCED ANOTHER LINEARITY WITHIN THE MOVE OF THE MENTAL FOCUS FROM ONE PART OF THE SHIP TO ANOTHER . THE REACTION TIME OF THE SUBJECTS INCREASED WITH DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS WHICH INDICATES THAT WE ACTUALLY CREATE A MENTAL PICTURE OF SCENES WHILE TRYING TO SOLVE SMALL COGNITIVE TASKS . INTERESTINGLY THIS VISUAL ABILITY CAN BE OBSERVED ALSO WITH CONGENITALLY BLIND AS MARMOR AND ZABACK ( 1976 ) FOUND OUT . PRESUMING THAT THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES ARE THE SAME OF SIGHTED SUBJECTS IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS A DEEPER ENCODED SYSTEM THAT HAS ACCESS TO MORE THAN THE VISUAL INPUT</pattern>
<template>Another seminal research in this field were Kosslyn's image-scanning experiments in the 1970s. Referring to the example of the mental representation of a ship, he experienced another linearity within the move of the mental focus from one part of the ship to another. The reaction time of the subjects increased with distance between the two parts, which indicates, that we actually create a mental picture of scenes while trying to solve small cognitive tasks. Interestingly, this visual ability can be observed also with congenitally blind, as Marmor and Zaback (1976) found out. Presuming, that the underlying processes are the same of sighted subjects, it could be concluded that there is a deeper encoded system that has access to more than the visual input.</template>

THEN THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE THIS PICTURE OR ARE QUESTIONED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE ORIENTATION OR THE COLOUR OF THE SHIP .

<template>Early experiments on imagery were already done in 1910 by Perky. He tried to find out, if there is any interaction between imagery and perception by a simple mechanism. Some subjects are told to project an image of common objects like a ship onto a wall. Without their knowledge there is a back projection, which subtly shines through the wall. Then they have to describe this picture, or are  questioned about for example the orientation or the colour of the ship. In Perkys experiment, none of the 20 subjects recognised that the description of the picture did not arise from their mind, but were completely influenced by the picture shown to them.</template>

<pattern>THESE EXTERNAL SYMBOLS ARE THEMSELVES INTERRELATED AND SPECIFIC GROUPINGS OF SYMBOLS MAY CONSTITUTE SELF-CONTAINED EXTERNAL MODELS OF GEOGRAPHIC SPACE . MAPS AND LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE CERTAINLY CLEAR EXAMPLES OF THIS . ELEMENTS OF DIFFERING FORM ( E.G . MAPS AND TEXT ) CAN ALSO BE INTERRELATED . THESE VARIOUS EXTERNAL MODELS OF GEOGRAPHIC SPACE CORRESPOND TO EXTERNAL MEMORY . FROM THE PERSPECTIVE JUST DESCRIBED THE TOTAL SUM OF ANY INDIVIDUAL S KNOWLEDGE IS CONTAINED IN A MULTIPLICITY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS THAT FUNCTION AS A SINGLE INTERACTIVE WHOLE . THE REPRESENTATION AS A WHOLE CAN THEREFORE BE CHARACTERISED AS A SYNERGISTIC SELF-ORGANISING AND HIGHLY DYNAMIC NETWORK</pattern>
<template>These external symbols are themselves interrelated, and specific groupings of symbols may constitute self-contained external models of geographic space. Maps and landscape photographs are certainly clear examples of this. Elements of differing form (e.g., maps and text) can also be interrelated. These various external models of geographic space correspond to external memory.
From the perspective just described, the total sum of any individual's knowledge is contained in a multiplicity of internal and external representations that function as a single, interactive whole. The representation as a whole can therefore be characterised as a synergistic, self-organising and highly dynamic network.</template>

<pattern>EACH EXTERNAL SYMBOL HAS MEANING THAT IS ACQUIRED THROUGH THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL PERCEIVER S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE . THAT MEANING IS IMPARTED BY BOTH THE SPECIFIC CULTURAL CONTEXT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND BY THE SPECIFIC MEANING INTENDED BY THE GENERATOR OF THAT SYMBOL . OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY ELEMENTS WITHIN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT NOT GENERATED BY ANYONE BUT THAT NEVERTHELESS ARE IMPARTED WITH VERY POWERFUL MEANING BY CULTURES ( E.G . THE SUN MOON AND STARS ) . MAN-MADE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING ELEMENTS SUCH AS BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ACT AS SYMBOLS AS AT LEAST PART OF THEIR FUNCTION . THE SHEER SIZE OF DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDINGS THE PILLARS OF A BANK FACADE AND CHURCH SPIRES POINTING SKYWARD ARE DESIGNED TO EVOKE AN IMPRESSION OF POWER STABILITY OR HOLINESS RESPECTIVELY</pattern>
<template>Each external symbol has meaning that is acquired through the sum of the individual perceiver's previous experience. That meaning is imparted by both the specific cultural context of that individual and by the specific meaning intended by the generator of that symbol. Of course, there are many elements within the natural environment not "generated" by anyone, but that nevertheless are imparted with very powerful meaning by cultures (e.g., the sun, moon and stars). Man-made elements within the environment, including elements such as buildings, are often specifically designed to act as symbols as at least part of their function. The sheer size of downtown office buildings, the pillars of a bank facade and church spires pointing skyward are designed to evoke an impression of power, stability or holiness, respectively.</template>

<pattern>THE RATIONALE IS AS FOLLOWS : WE GAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT FROM DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE ; BY NAVIGATING THROUGH AND INTERACTING DIRECTLY WITH GEOGRAPHIC SPACE AS WELL AS BY READING MAPS THROUGH LANGUAGE PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION MEDIA . WITHIN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERIENCE WE ENCOUNTER ELEMENTS WITHIN THE EXTERNAL WORLD THAT ACT AS SYMBOLS . THESE SYMBOLS WHETHER A LANDMARK WITHIN THE REAL LANDSCAPE A WORD OR PHRASE A LINE ON A MAP OR A BUILDING IN A PHOTOGRAPH TRIGGER OUR INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND GENERATE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES . IN OTHER WORDS ELEMENTS THAT WE ENCOUNTER WITHIN OUR ENVIRONMENT ACT AS EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE STORES</pattern>
<template>The rationale is as follows: We gain information about our external environment from different kinds of perceptual experience; by navigating through and interacting directly with geographic space as well as by reading maps, through language, photographs and other communication media. Within all of these different types of experience, we encounter elements within the external world that act as symbols. These symbols, whether a landmark within the real landscape, a word or phrase, a line on a map or a building in a photograph, trigger our internal knowledge representation and generate appropriate responses. In other words, elements that we encounter within our environment act as external knowledge stores.</template>

<pattern>THE CLASSICAL APPROACH ASSUMES A COMPLEX INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN THE MIND THAT IS CONSTRUCTED THROUGH A SERIES OF SPECIFIC PERCEIVED STIMULI AND THAT THESE STIMULI GENERATE SPECIFIC INTERNAL RESPONSES . RESEARCH DEALING SPECIFICALLY WITH GEOGRAPHIC-SCALE SPACE HAS WORKED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THE MACRO-SCALE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND ESSENTIALLY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE INDIVIDUAL . THIS RESEARCH SUCH AS THAT OF LYNCH AND OF GOLLEDGE ( 1987 ) AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS A COMPLEX OF BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES GENERATED FROM CORRESPONDING COMPLEX EXTERNAL STIMULI WHICH ARE THEMSELVES INTERRELATED . MOREOVER THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH OFFERS A VIEW OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE AS A HIGHLY INTERRELATED EXTERNAL / INTERNAL SYSTEM . USING LANDMARKS ENCOUNTERED WITHIN THE EXTERNAL LANDSCAPE AS NAVIGATIONAL CUES IS THE CLEAREST EXAMPLE OF THIS INTERRELATIONSHIP</pattern>
<template>The classical approach assumes a complex internal representation in the mind that is constructed through a series of specific perceived stimuli, and that these stimuli generate specific internal responses. Research dealing specifically with geographic-scale space has worked from the perspective that the macro-scale physical environment is extremely complex and essentially beyond the control of the individual. This research, such as that of Lynch and of Golledge (1987) and his colleagues, has shown that there is a complex of behavioural responses generated from corresponding complex external stimuli, which are themselves interrelated. Moreover, the results of this research offers a view of our geographic knowledge as a highly interrelated external/internal system. Using landmarks encountered within the external landscape as navigational cues is the clearest example of this interrelationship.</template>

<pattern>THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THIS SYSTEM IS TO ORGANIZE SPATIAL INFORMATION IN A GENERAL FORM THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY EITHER PERCEPTUAL OR LINGUISTIC MECHANISMS . IT ALSO PROVIDES COORDINATE FRAMEWORKS TO DESCRIBE OBJECT LOCATIONS THUS CREATING A MODEL OF A PERCEIVED OR DESCRIBED ENVIRONMENT . THE ADVANTAGE OF A COORDINATE REPRESENTATION IS THAT IT IS DIRECTLY ANALOGOUS TO THE STRUCTURE OF REAL SPACE AND CAPTURES ALL POSSIBLE RELATIONS BETWEEN OBJECTS ENCODED IN THE COORDINATE SPACE . THESE FRAMEWORKS ALSO REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN THE SALIENCE OF OBJECTS AND LOCATIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPERTIES OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS THE WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE INTERACT WITH IT . THUS THE REPRESENTATIONS CREATED ARE MODELS OF PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT</pattern>
<template>The primary role of this system is to organize spatial information in a general form that can be accessed by either perceptual or linguistic mechanisms. It also provides coordinate frameworks to describe object locations, thus creating a model of a perceived or described environment. The advantage of a coordinate representation is that it is directly analogous to the structure of real space and captures all possible relations between objects encoded in the coordinate space. These frameworks also reflect differences in the salience of objects and locations consistent with the properties of the environment, as well as the ways in which people interact with it. Thus, the representations created are models of physical and functional aspects of the environment.</template>

ALMOST ALL SUBJECTS ASSOCIATED THE WORD CHILDREN TO THE GIVEN WORD SLOW ALTHOUGH THE WORD BREAD HAS A POSITION THAT IS MORE CLOSE TO THE GIVEN WORD SLOW THAN THE WORD CHILDREN . AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS THAT THE SENTENCE IS STORED IN THE MEMORY USING THE THREE PROPOSITIONS CHILDREN ARE SLOW CHILDREN EAT BREAD AND BREAD IS COLD . THE SUBJECTS ASSOCIATED THE WORD CHILDREN WITH THE GIVEN WORD SLOW BECAUSE BOTH BELONG TO ONE PROPOSITION WHILE BREAD AND SLOW BELONG TO DIFFERENT ONES . THE SAME EVIDENCE WAS PROVEN IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT BY RATCLIFF AND MCKOON IN 1978</pattern>
<template>In an experiment by Weisberg in 1969, subjects had to memorise sentences like
"Children who are slow eat bread that is cold". Then the subjects were asked to
associate the first word from the sentence that comes in their mind to a word given
by the experiment conductor. Almost all subjects associated the word "children" to the given
word "slow", although the word "bread" has a position that is more close to the given
word "slow" than the word "children". An explanation for this is that the sentence is
stored in the memory using the three propositions "Children are slow", "Children
eat bread" and "Bread is cold". The subjects associated the word "children" with
the given word "slow", because both belong to one proposition, while "bread" and
"slow" belong to different ones. The same evidence was proven in another experiment

<pattern>THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF SCHEMES IS ORGANISED IN CATEGORIES . FOR EXAMPLE HOUSE BELONGS TO THE CATEGORY BUILDING ( WHICH HAS OF COURSE ITS OWN SCHEMA ) AND CONTAINS ALL ATTRIBUTES AND VALUES OF THE PARENT SCHEMA PLUS ITS OWN SPECIFIC VALUES AND ATTRIBUTES . THIS WAY OF ORGANISING OBJECTS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT INTO HIERARCHICAL MODELS ENABLES US TO RECOGNISE OBJECTS WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN OUR LIFE BECAUSE THEY CAN POSSIBLY BE RELATED TO CATEGORIES WE ALREADY KNOW</pattern>
<template>The hierarchical structure of schemes is organised in categories. For example, "house"
belongs to the category "building" (which has of course its own schema) and contains
all attributes and values of the parent schema plus its own specific values and attributes.
This way of organising objects in our environment into hierarchical models enables us to
recognise objects we have never seen before in our life, because they can possibly be related to categories we already know.</template>

<pattern>IN FIGURE 1 EACH CIRCLE REPRESENTS A SINGLE PROPOSITION . REGARDING THE FACT THAT SOME COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED TO MORE THAN ONE PROPOSITION THEY CONSTRUCT A NETWORK OF PROPOSITIONS . PROPOSITIONAL NETWORKS CAN ALSO HAVE A HIERARCHY IF A SINGLE COMPONENT OF A PROPOSITION IS NOT A SINGLE OBJECT BUT A PROPOSITION ITSELF . AN EXAMPLE OF A HIERARCHICAL PROPOSITIONAL NETWORK DESCRIBING THE SENTENCE JOHN BELIEVES THAT ANNA WILL PASS HER EXAM IS ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 2</pattern>
<template>In Figure 1, each circle represents a single proposition. Regarding the fact that
some components are connected to more than one proposition, they
construct a network of propositions. Propositional networks can also have a hierarchy,
if a single component of a proposition is not a single object, but a proposition
itself. An example of a hierarchical propositional network describing the sentence
"John believes that Anna will pass her exam" is illustrated in Figure 2.</template>

<pattern>IF THERE IS A SENTENCE LIKE DEBBY DONATED A BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GREENPEACE AN ORGANISATION WHICH PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT IT CAN BE RECAPITULATED BY THE PROPOSITIONS DEBBY DONATED MONEY TO GREENPEACE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS BIG AND GREENPEACE PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT . THE TRUTH VALUE OF THE WHOLE SENTENCE DEPENDS ON THE TRUTH VALUES OF ITS CONSTITUENTS . HENCE IF ONE OF THE PROPOSITIONS IS FALSE SO IS THE WHOLE SENTENCE</pattern>
<template>If there is a sentence like "Debby donated a big amount of money to Greenpeace,
an organisation which protects the environment", it can be recapitulated by the propositions "Debby donated money to Greenpeace", "The amount of
money was big" and "Greenpeace protects the environment". The truth value of the whole sentence depends on the truth values of its constituents. Hence, if one of the propositions is false, so is the whole sentence.</template>

<pattern>THE BASIC IDEA OF THE PROPOSITIONAL REPRESENTATION IS THAT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OBJECTS ARE REPRESENTED BY SYMBOLS AND NOT BY SPATIAL MENTAL IMAGES OF THE SCENE . FOR EXAMPLE A BOTTLE UNDER A TABLE WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY A FORMULA MADE OF SYMBOLS LIKE UNDER ( BOTTLE TABLE ) . THE TERM PROPOSITION IS LEND FROM THE DOMAINS OF LOGIC AND LINGUISTICS AND MEANS THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE ENTITY OF INFORMATION . EACH PROPOSITION CAN EITHER BE TRUE OR FALSE</pattern>
<template>The basic idea of the propositional representation is that relationships between objects
are represented by symbols and not by spatial mental images of the scene. For
example, a bottle under a table would be represented by a formula made of symbols

Linguistics and means the smallest possible entity of information. Each proposition can either be true or false.</template>

<template>The theory of Propositional Representation was founded by Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn
who invented it in 1973. He described it as an epiphenomenon which accompanies
the process of imagery, but is not part of it. Mental images do not show us how
the mind works exactly. They only show us that something is happening. Just like
the display of a compact disc player. There are flashing lights that display that
something happens. We are also able to conclude what happens, but the display
does not show us how the processes inside the compact disc player work. Even if
the display would be broken, the compact disc player would still continue to play
music.</template>

<pattern>ALZHEIMER ’ S PROGRESS IS SEPARATED INTO THREE STAGES : IN THE EARLY STAGES ( 1 ) TANGLES AND PLAQUES BEGIN TO EVOLVE IN BRAIN AREAS WHERE LEARNING MEMORY THINKING AND PLANNING TAKES PLACE . THIS MAY BEGIN 20 YEARS BEFORE DIAGNOSIS . IN THE MIDDLE STAGES ( 2 ) PLAQUES AND TANGLES START TO SPREAD TO AREAS OF SPEAKING AND UNDERSTANDING SPEECH . ALSO THE SENSE OF WHERE YOUR BODY IS IN RELATION TO OBJECTS AROUND YOU IS REDUCED . THIS MAY LAST FROM 2 – 10 YEARS . IN ADVANCED ALZHEIMER ’ S DISEASE ( 3 ) MOST OF THE CORTEX IS DAMAGED SO THAT THE BRAIN STARTS TO SHRINK SERIOUSLY AND CELLS BEGIN TO DIE . THE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK AND COMMUNICATE AND THEY DO NOT RECOGNISE THEIR FAMILY OR PEOPLE THEY KNOW . THIS STAGE MAY GENERALLY LAST FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS</pattern>
<template>Alzheimer’s progress is separated into three stages: 
In the early stages (1), tangles and plaques begin to evolve in brain areas where learning, memory, thinking and planning takes place. This may begin 20 years before diagnosis.
In the middle stages (2), plaques and tangles start to spread to areas of speaking and understanding speech. Also the sense of where your body is in relation to objects around you is reduced. This may last from 2–10 years.
In advanced Alzheimer’s disease (3), most of the cortex is damaged, so that the brain starts to shrink seriously and cells begin to die. The people lose their ability to speak and communicate and they do not recognise their family or people they know. This stage may generally last from one to five years.</template>

<pattern>SCIENTISTS SAY THAT LONG BEFORE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS APPEAR NERVE CELLS THAT STORE AND RETRIEVE INFORMATION HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO DEGENERATE . THERE ARE TWO THEORIES GIVING AN EXPLANATION FOR THE CAUSES OF ALZHEIMER ’ S DISEASE . THE FIRST DESCRIBES PLAQUES AS PROTEIN FRAGMENTS WHICH DEFECT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN NERVE CELLS . THEY ARISE WHEN LITTLE FRAGMENTS RELEASE FROM NERVE CELL WALLS AND ASSOCIATE WITH OTHER FRAGMENTS FROM OUTSIDE THE CELL . THESE COMBINED FRAGMENTS CALLED PLAQUES APPEND TO THE OUTSIDE OF NERVE CELLS AND DESTROY THE CONNECTIONS . THEN THE NERVE CELLS START TO DIE BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER PROVIDED WITH NUTRIENTS . AS A CONCLUSION THE STIMULI ARE NO LONGER TRANSFERRED . THE SECOND THEORY EXPLAINS THAT TANGLES LIMIT THE FUNCTIONS OF NERVE CELLS . THEY ARE TWISTED FIBERS OF ANOTHER PROTEIN THAT FORM INSIDE BRAIN CELLS AND DESTROY THE VITAL CELL TRANSPORT MADE OF PROTEINS . BUT SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT YET FOUND OUT THE EXACT ROLE OF PLAQUES AND TANGLES</pattern>
<template>Scientists say that long before the first symptoms appear nerve cells that store and retrieve information have already begun to degenerate.
There are two theories giving an explanation for the causes of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first describes plaques as protein fragments which defect the connection between nerve cells. They arise when little fragments release from nerve cell walls and associate with other fragments from outside the cell. These combined fragments, called plaques, append to the outside of nerve cells and destroy the connections. Then the nerve cells start to die because they are no longer provided with nutrients. As a conclusion the stimuli are no longer transferred. 
The second theory explains that tangles limit the functions of nerve cells. They are twisted fibers of another protein that form inside brain cells and destroy the vital cell transport made of proteins.
But scientists have not yet found out the exact role of plaques and tangles.</template>

<pattern>OBVIOUSLY CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO CONJUGATE VERBS AND TO DECLINE NOUNS USING REGULAR RULES . TO PRODUCE IRREGULAR FORMS IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE LEARNT AND STORED IN LONG-TERM MEMORY ONE BY ONE . RATHER THAN THE REPETITION OF WORDS THE OBSERVATION OF SPEECH IS IMPORTANT TO ACQUIRE GRAMMATICAL SKILLS . AROUND THE THIRD BIRTHDAY THE COMPLEXITY OF LANGUAGE INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY AND REACHES A RATE OF ABOUT 1000 SYNTACTIC TYPES . ANOTHER INTERESTING FIELD CONCERNING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MEMORY AND LANGUAGE IS MULTILINGUALISM . THINKING ABOUT CHILDREN EDUCATED BILINGUAL THE QUESTION ARISES HOW THE TWO LANGUAGES ARE SEPARATED OR COMBINED IN THE BRAIN . SCIENTISTS ASSUME THAT ESPECIALLY LEXICAL INFORMATION IS STORED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EACH LANGUAGE ; THE SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC LEVELS RATHER COULD BE UNIFIED . EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT BILINGUALS HAVE A MORE CAPACIOUS SPAN OF MEMORY WHEN THEY LISTEN TO WORDS NOT ONLY IN ONE BUT IN BOTH LANGUAGES</pattern>
<template>Obviously children are able to conjugate verbs and to decline nouns using regular rules. To produce irregular forms is more difficult, because they have to be learnt and stored in Long-term memory one by one. Rather than the repetition of words, the observation of speech is important to acquire grammatical skills. Around the third birthday the complexity of language increases exponentially and reaches a rate of about 1000 syntactic types.
Another interesting field concerning the correlation between Memory and Language is Multilingualism. Thinking about children educated bilingual, the question arises how the two languages are separated or combined in the brain. Scientists assume that especially lexical information is stored independently for each language; the semantic and syntactic levels rather could be unified. Experiments have shown that bilinguals have a more capacious span of memory when they listen to words not only in one but in both languages.</template>

<template>Locke’s theory about the usage of the first word is only a general tendency. Other researchers like Charlotte Bühler (1928), a German psychologist, think that the age of speaking the first word is around the tenth month, whereas Elizabeth Bates et al.

Until the second year of life a vocabulary of about 50 words evolves, four times more than the child utilises. Two thirds of the language processed is still babbling. After this stage of learning the vocabulary increases rapidly. The so called vocabulary spurt causes an increment of about one word every two hours. From now on children learn to have fluent conversations with a simple grammar containing errors.</template>

<template>Language is an essential system for communication which highly influences our life. This system uses sounds, symbols and gestures for the purpose of communication.
Visual and auditory systems of a human body are the entrance-pathway for language to enter the brain. The motor system is responsible for speech and writing production, it serves as exit-pathway for language. The nature of language exists in the brain processes between the sensory and motor systems, especially between visual or auditory income and written or spoken outcome.
The biggest part of the knowledge about brain mechanism for language is deduced from studies of language deficits resulting from brain damage. Even if there are about 10 000 different languages and dialects in the world, all of them express the subtleties of human experience and emotion.</template>

<template>Memory is the ability of the nervous system to receive and keep information.
It is divided into three parts: Sensory memory, Short-term memory and Long-term memory. Sensory memory holds information for milliseconds and is separated into two components. The iconic memory is responsible for visual information, whereas auditory information is processed in the echoic memory. Short-term memory keeps information for at most half a minute. Long-term memory, which can store information over decades, consists of the conscious explicit and the unconscious implicit memory. Explicit memory, also known as declarative, can be subdivided into semantic and episodic memory. Procedural memory and priming effects are components of the implicit memory.</template>

<pattern>IF ONE CANNOT REMEMBER AN EVENT OR DETAIL IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MEMORY IS COMPLETELY LOST . INSTEAD ONE WOULD SAY THAT THESE MEMORIES ARE REPRESSED WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CANNOT EASILY BE REMEMBERED . THE PROCESS OF REMEMBERING IN THESE CASES IS CALLED RECOVERY . RECOVERING OF A REPRESSED MEMORY USUALLY OCCURS DUE TO A RETRIEVAL CUE . THIS MIGHT BE AN OBJECT OR A SCENE THAT REMINDS ONE OF SOMETHING WHICH HAS HAPPENED LONG AGO . TRAUMATIC EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED DURING CHILDHOOD FOR EXAMPLE CAN BE RECOVERED WITH THE HELP OF A THERAPIST . THIS WAY PERPETRATORS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL AFTER DECADES . STILL THE CORRECTNESS OF THE “ RECOVERED ” MEMORY IS NOT GUARANTEED : AS WE KNOW MEMORY IS NOT RELIABLE AND IF THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT IS SUGGESTIBLE ONE MIGHT PRODUCE A FALSE MEMORY . LOOK AT THE ILLUSTRATION TO THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO THESE PROCESSES</pattern>
<template>If one cannot remember an event or detail, it does not mean that the memory is completely lost. Instead one would say that these memories are repressed, which means that they cannot easily be remembered. The process of remembering in these cases is called recovery. 
Recovering of a repressed memory usually occurs due to a retrieval cue. This might be an object or a scene that reminds one of something which has happened long ago.
Traumatic events, which happened during childhood for example, can be recovered with the help of a therapist.  This way, perpetrators have been brought to trial after decades. 
Still, the correctness of the “recovered” memory is not guaranteed: as we know, memory is not reliable and if the occurrence of an event is suggestible one might produce a false memory.
Look at the illustration to the right to be able to relate to these processes.</template>

<template>There are moments in our lives that we are sure we will never forget. It is generally perceived that the memories of events that we are emotionally involved with are remembered for a longer time than others and that we know every little detail of them. These kinds of memories are called Flashbulb Memories.
The accuracy of the memories is an illusion, though. The more time passes, the more these memories have changed while our feeling of certainty and accuracy increases. Examples for Flashbulb Memories are one’s wedding, the birth of one’s child or tragedies like September 11th.</template>

<template>With this strategy you bundled eight pieces of information (eight digits) to three pieces with help to remember them as a date schema.  
A famous experiment concerned with chunking was conducted by Chase and Simon (1973)[11]  with novices and experts in chess playing. When asked to remember certain arrangements of chess pieces on the board, the experts performed significantly better that the novices. However, if the pieces were arranged arbitrarily, i.e. not corresponding to possible game situations, both the experts and the novices performed equally poorly. The experienced chess players do not try to remember single positions of the figures in the correct game situation, but whole bundles of figures as already seen before in a game. In incorrect game situations this strategy cannot work which shows that chunking (as done by experienced chess players) enhances the performance only in specific memory tasks.</template>

<template>Depression is a disorder that leads to an emotional disfunction characterized by a state of intensive sadness, melancholia and despair. The disorder affects social and everyday life. There are many different forms of depression that differ in strength and duration. 
People affected by depression suffer from anxiety, distorted thinking, dramatic mood changes and many other symptoms. They feel sad, and everything seems to be bleak. This leads to an extremely negative view of themselves and their current and future situation. These factors can lead to a loss of a normal social life that might affect the depressed person even further. Suffering from depression and losing your social network can thereby lead to a vicious circle.</template>

<pattern>MEMORY OCCURS WHERE THE CONGRUENCE OF CURRENT MOOD WITH THE MOOD AT THE TIME OF MEMORY STORAGE HELPS RECALL OF THAT MEMORY . WHEN WE ARE HAPPY WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMEMBER OTHER TIMES WHEN WE WERE HAPPY . SO IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER SOMETHING GET INTO THE MOOD YOU WERE IN WHEN YOU EXPERIENCED IT . YOU CAN EASILY TRY THIS YOURSELF . YOU JUST HAVE TO BRING INTO A CERTAIN MOOD BY LISTENING TO THE SADDEST / HAPPIEST MUSIC YOU KNOW . NOW YOU LEARN A LIST OF WORDS . THEN YOU TRY TO RECALL THE LIST IN THE OTHER / THE SAME MOOD . YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU REMEMBER THE LIST BETTER WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SAME MOOD AS YOU WERE WHILE LEARNING IT</pattern>
<template>Memory occurs where the congruence of current mood with the mood at the time of memory storage helps recall of that memory. When we are happy, we are more likely to remember other times when we were happy. So, if you want to remember something, get into the mood you were in when you experienced it.
You can easily try this yourself. You just have to bring into a certain mood by listening to the saddest/happiest music you know. Now you learn a list of words. Then you try to recall the list in the other/the same mood. You will see that you remember the list better when you are in the same mood as you were while learning it.</template>

<pattern>MEMORY OCCURS WHERE CURRENT MOOD HELPS RECALL OF MOOD-CONGRUENT MATERIAL E.G . CHARACTERS IN STORIES THAT FEEL LIKE THE READER FEELS WHILE READING REGARDLESS OF OUR MOOD AT THE TIME THE MATERIAL WAS STORED . THUS WHEN WE ARE HAPPY WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMEMBER HAPPY EVENTS . ALSO REMEMBERING ALL OF THE NEGATIVE EVENTS OF OUR PAST WHEN DEPRESSED IS AN EXAMPLE OF MOOD CONGRUENCE . THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN RATHER REMEMBER A FUNERAL WHERE YOU WERE HAPPY IN A HAPPY MOOD WHILE YOU REMEMBER A PARTY WHERE YOU WERE SAD IN A SAD MOOD ALTHOUGH A FUNERAL IS SAD AND A PARTY IS HAPPY</pattern>
<template>Memory occurs where current mood helps recall of mood-congruent material, e.g. characters in stories that feel like the reader feels while reading, regardless of our mood at  the time the material was stored.
Thus when we are happy, we are more likely to remember happy events. Also remembering all of the negative events of our past when depressed is an example of mood congruence. That means that you can rather remember a funeral where you were happy in a happy mood while you remember a party where you were sad in a sad mood, although a funeral is sad and a party is happy.</template>

<pattern>EMPATHY IS THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE OTHERS ’ EMOTIONS AND THEIR POINT OF VIEW . SIMULATION THEORY STATES THAT THE SAME NEURAL AND COGNITIVE RESOURCES ARE USED BY PERCEIVING THE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS OF OTHERS AND BY PRODUCING ACTIONS AND THIS EXPRESSIONS IN ONESELF . IF YOU ARE WATCHING A MOVIE WHERE ONE PERSON TOUCHES ANOTHER THE SAME NEURAL MECHANISM ( IN THE SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX ) IS ACTIVATED AS IF YOU WERE PHYSICALLY TOUCHED . FURTHER STUDIES INVESTIGATED EMPATHY FOR PAIN . THAT MEANS IF YOU SEE SOMEONE EXPERIENCING PAIN TWO REGIONS IN YOUR BRAIN ARE OVERLAPPING . THE FIRST REGION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPECTING ANOTHER PERSON ’ S PAIN AND THE SECOND REGION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPERIENCING THIS PAIN ONESELF</pattern>
<template>Empathy is the ability to appreciate others’ emotions and their point of view. Simulation theory states that the same neural and cognitive resources are used by perceiving the emotional expressions of others and by producing actions and this expressions in oneself. If you are watching a movie where one person touches another, the same neural mechanism (in the somatosensory cortex) is activated as if you were physically touched. Further studies investigated empathy for pain. That means, if you see someone experiencing pain, two regions in your brain are overlapping. The first region is  responsible for expecting another person’s pain, and the second region is responsible for experiencing this pain oneself.</template>

<pattern>THIS CURRENT THEORY OF EMOTIONS ( FROM A . DAMASIO ) EMPHASIZES THE ROLE OF BODILY STATES AND IMPLIES THAT “ SOMATIC MARKER ” SIGNALS HAVE INFLUENCE ON BEHAVIOUR LIKE PARTICULARLY REASONING AND DECISION – MAKING . SOMATIC MARKERS ARE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PREVIOUS SITUATIONS WHICH ARE STORED IN THE CORTEX AND THE BODILY FEELING OF SUCH SITUATIONS ( E.G . STORED IN THE AMYGDALA ) . FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SOMATIC MARKERS ARE VERY USEFUL DURING THE DECISION PROCESS BECAUSE THEY CAN GIVE YOU IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ON THE GROUNDS OF PREVIOUS ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WHETHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER OPTION “ FEELS ” BETTER . PEOPLE WHO ARE CHEATING AND MURDERING WITHOUT FEELING ANYTHING MISS SOMATIC MARKERS WHICH WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THIS</pattern>
<template>This current theory of emotions (from A. Damasio) emphasizes the role of bodily states and implies that “somatic marker” signals have influence on behaviour, like particularly reasoning and decision–making. Somatic markers are the connections between previous situations, which are stored in the cortex, and the bodily feeling of such situations (e.g. stored in the amygdala). From this it follows, that the somatic markers are very useful during the decision process, because they can give you immediate response on the grounds of previous acquired knowledge, whether the one or the other option “feels” better. People who are cheating and murdering without feeling anything miss somatic markers which would prevent them from doing this.</template>

<pattern>THE TWO FACTOR THEORY VIEWS EMOTION AS AN COMPOUND OF THE TWO FACTORS : PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL AND COGNITION . SCHACTER AND SINGER ( 1962 ) DID WELL-KNOWN STUDIES IN THIS FIELD OF RESEARCH . THEY INJECTED PARTICIPANTS WITH ADRENALINE ( CALLED EPINEPHRINE IN THE USA ) . THIS IS A DRUG THAT CAUSES A NUMBER OF EFFECTS LIKE INCREASED BLOOD FLOW TO THE MUSCLES AND INCREASED HEART RATE . THE RESULT WAS THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE DRUG IN THE BODY DID NOT LEAD TO EXPERIENCES OF EMOTION . JUST WITH THE PRESENCE OF AN COGNITIVE SETTING LIKE AN ANGRY MAN IN THE ROOM PARTICIPANTS DID SELF – REPORT AN EMOTION . CONTRARY TO THE JAMES – LANGE THEORY THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT BODILY CHANGES CAN ONLY SUPPORT CONSCIOUS EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES BUT DO NOT CREATE EMOTIONS . THEREFORE THE INTERPRETATION OF A CERTAIN EMOTION DEPENDS ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE IN CORRELATION TO THE SUBJECTS CIRCUMSTANCES</pattern>
<template>The two factor theory views emotion as an compound of the two factors: physiological arousal and cognition. Schacter and Singer (1962) did well-known studies in this field of research. They injected participants with adrenaline (called epinephrine in the USA). This is a drug that causes a number of effects like increased blood flow to the muscles and increased heart rate. The result was that the existence of the drug in the body did not lead to experiences of emotion. Just with the presence of an cognitive setting, like an angry man in the room, participants did self – report an emotion. Contrary to the James – Lange theory this study suggests that bodily changes can only support conscious emotional experiences but do not create emotions. Therefore, the interpretation of a certain emotion depends on the physiological state in correlation to the subjects circumstances.</template>

<pattern>THE JAMES – LANGE THEORY OF EMOTION STATES THAT THE SELF – PERCEPTION OF BODILY CHANGES PRODUCES EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE . FOR EXAMPLE YOU ARE HAPPY BECAUSE YOU ARE LAUGHING OR YOU FEEL SAD BECAUSE YOU ARE CRYING . ALTERNATIVELY WHEN A PERSON SEES A SPIDER HE OR SHE MIGHT EXPERIENCE FEAR . ONE PROBLEM ACCORDING THIS THEORY IS THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT KIND OF PROCESSING LEADS TO THE CHANGES IN THE BODILY STATE AND WETHER THIS PROCESS CAN BE SEEN AS A PART OF THE EMOTION ITSELF . HOWEVER PEOPLE PARALYZED FROM THE NECK DOWN WHO HAVE LITTLE AWARENESS OF SENSORY INPUT ARE STILL ABLE TO EXPERIENCE EMOTIONS . ALSO RESEARCH BY SCHACTER AND SINGER HAS SHOWN THAT CHANGES IN BODILY STATE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE EMOTIONS . BECAUSE OF THAT AN EXTENSION OF THIS THEORY WAS NECESSARY</pattern>
<template>The James – Lange theory of emotion states that the self – perception of bodily changes produces emotional experience. For example you are happy because you are laughing or you feel sad because you are crying. Alternatively, when a person sees a spider he or she might experience fear. One problem according this theory is that it is not clear what kind of processing leads to the changes in the bodily state and wether this process can be seen as a part of the emotion itself. However, people paralyzed from the neck down, who have little awareness of sensory input are still able to experience emotions. Also, research by Schacter and Singer has shown, that changes in bodily state are not enough to produce emotions. Because of that, an extension of this theory was necessary.</template>

PATIENTS WITH THE HUNTINGTON S DISEASE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH RECOGNIZING DISGUST . THE INSULA A SMALL REGION OF CORTEX BURIED BENEATH THE TEMPORAL LOBES PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF DISGUST . FURTHERMORE THE HALF OF THE PATIENTS WITH A DAMAGED AMYGDALA HAVE PROBLEMS WITH FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF SADNESS . THE DAMAGE OF THE VENTRAL REGIONS OF THE BASAL GANGLIA CAUSES THE DEFICIT IN THE SELECTIVE PERCEPTION OF ANGER AND THIS BRAIN AREA COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERCEPTION OF AGGRESSION . HAPPINESS CANNOT BE SELECTIVELY IMPAIRED BECAUSE IT CONSIST OF A MORE DISTRIBUTED NETWORK</pattern>
<template>Another basic emotional category which is largely independent of other emotions is disgust. It literally means „bad taste“ and is evolutionary related to contamination through ingestion. Patients with the Huntington's disease have problems with recognizing disgust. The insula, a small region of cortex buried beneath the temporal lobes, plays an important role for facial expressions of disgust. Furthermore, the half of the patients with a damaged amygdala have problems with facial expressions of sadness. The damage of the ventral regions of the basal ganglia causes the deficit in the selective perception of anger and this brain area could be responsible for the perception of aggression. Happiness cannot be selectively impaired because it consist of a more distributed network.</template>

<pattern>1949 PAUL MACLEAN EXTENDED THIS THEORY BY HYPOTHEZING THAT REGIONS LIKE THE AMYGDALA AND THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX WORK TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUIT AND FORM AN EMOTIONAL BRAIN . HOWEVER THE THEORY OF THE PAPEZ CIRCUIT COULD NO LONGER BE HELD BECAUSE FOR ONE SOME REGIONS OF THE CIRCUIT CAN NO LONGER BE RELATED TO FUNCTIONS TO WHICH THEY WERE ASCRIBED PRIMARILY . AND SECONDLY CURRENT STATE OF RESEARCH CONCLUDES THAT EACH BASIC EMOTION HAS ITS OWN CIRCUIT . FURTHERMORE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE LIMBIC SYSTEM IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FUNCTIONS IS OUT-DATED . OTHER CORTICAL AND NON-CORTICAL STRUCTURES OF THE BRAIN HAVE AN ENORMOUS BEARING ON THE LIMBIC SYSTEM . SO THE EMERGENCE OF EMOTION IS ALWAYS AN INTERACTION OF MANY PARTS OF THE BRAIN</pattern>
<template>1949 Paul MacLean extended this theory by hypothezing that regions like the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex work together with the circuit and form an emotional brain. However, the theory of the Papez circuit could no longer be held because, for one, some regions of the circuit can no longer be related to functions to which they were ascribed primarily. And secondly, current state of research concludes that each basic emotion has its own circuit. Furthermore, the assumption that the limbic system is solely responsible for these functions is out-dated. Other cortical and non-cortical structures of the brain have an enormous bearing on the limbic system. So the emergence of emotion is always an interaction of many parts of the brain.</template>

<pattern>THIS IS ALSO ALWAYS CONNECTED WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GREATER RESPONSE TO NOVEL EXPERIENCE . SOMETHING THAT IS UNEXPECTED OR UNSEEN YET . WHEN CHILDREN GET NEW TOYS THEY ARE VERY EXCITED AT FIRST BUT AFTER A WHILE ONE CAN PERCEIVE OR SIMPLY REMEMBER THEIR OWN CHILDHOOD THAT THEY SHOW LESS INTEREST IN THAT TOY . THAT SHOWS THAT EMOTIONAL RESPONSE DECLINES DURING TIME . THIS ASPECT IS CALLED THE PROCESS OF ADAPTATION . THE THRESHOLD OF AWARENESS KEEPS RISING IF STIMULUS LEVEL IS CONSTANT . HENCE AWARENESS DECREASES . THE ORGANISM WITHDRAWS ITS CONSCIOUSNESS FROM MORE AND MORE EVENTS . THE PERSON HAS THE PIP IT HAS ENOUGH . THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IS ALSO POSSIBLE . IT IS KNOWN AS THE PROCESS OF FACILITATION . IN THIS CASE THE THRESHOLD OF AWARENESS DIMINISHES</pattern>
<template>This is also always connected with the fact that we have greater response to novel experience. Something that is unexpected or unseen yet. When children get new toys, they are very excited at first, but after a while one can perceive, or simply remember their own childhood, that they show less interest in that toy. That shows, that emotional response declines during time. This aspect is called the process of adaptation. The threshold of awareness keeps rising if stimulus level is constant. Hence, awareness decreases. The organism withdraws its consciousness from more and more events. The person has the pip, it has enough. The opposite effect is also possible. It is known as the process of facilitation. In this case the threshold of awareness diminishes.</template>

WE FEEL NO EMOTION IN RESPONSE TO CHANGE WHICH WE PERCEIVE AS UNIMPORTANT OR UNRELATED . ROUGHLY ONE CAN SAY THAT EMOTIONS EXPRESS OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD UNSTABLE SIGNIFICANT OBJECTS WHICH ARE SOMEHOW RELATED TO US</pattern>
<template>Significance presupposes order and relations. Relations are to meaning as colours are to vision: a necessary condition, but not its whole content. One determines the significance and the scope of a change by f.e. event´s impact (event´s strength), reality, relevance and factors related to the background circumstances of the subject. We feel no emotion in response to change which we perceive as unimportant or unrelated. Roughly one can say that emotions express our attitude toward unstable significant objects which are somehow related to us.</template>

<template>Current research in this field suggest that changes are needed to emerge emotions,so we can say that it is strong attention dependent. The event has to draw our attention. No recognition, no emotions. But do we have always an emotional evaluation, when we are aware of certain events? How has the change to be relevant for our recognition? Emotional changes are highly personal significant, saying that it needs a relation to our personal self.</template>

<pattern>AWARENESS IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT OR IN THE PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE . WHY RECOGNISE CHANGES RATHER THAN STABLE STATES ? AN ANSWER COULD BE THAT CHANGES ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR SITUATION . THEY SHOW THAT OUR SITUATION IS UNSTABLE . PAYING ATTENTION OR FOCUSING ON THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE CHANCE TO SURVIVE . A CHANGE BEARS MORE INFORMATION THAN REPETITIVE EVENTS . THIS APPEARS MORE EXCITING . REPETITION REDUCES EXCITEMENT . IF WE THINK THAT WE GOT THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM A SITUATION OR AN EVENT WE BECOME UNAWARE OF SUCH AN EVENT OR CERTAIN FACTS</pattern>
<template>Awareness is closely connected with changes in the environment or in the psycho-physiological state. Why recognise changes rather than stable states? An answer could be that changes are an important indicator of our situation. They show that our situation is unstable. Paying attention or focusing on that might increase the chance to survive. A change bears more information than repetitive events. This appears more exciting. Repetition reduces excitement. If we think that we got the most important information from a situation or an event,we become unaware of such an event or certain facts.</template>

<template>Complex emotions like jealousy, love and pride are different from basic emotions as they comprehend awareness of oneself in relation to other people and one's attitude towards other people. Hence they come along with a more complex attributional process which is required to appreciate thoughts and beliefs of other people. Complex emotions are more likely be dependent on cultural influences than basic types of emotions. If you think of Knut who is feeling embarrassment, you have to consider what kind of action he committed in which situation and how this action raised the disapproval of other people.</template>

<pattern>ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES BY ECKMAN AND FRIESEN WHICH IS BASED ON THE COMPARISON OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF EMOTIONS IN DIFFERENT CULTURES CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE SIX BASIC TYPES OF EMOTIONS EXPRESSED IN FACES - NAMELY SADNESS HAPPINESS DISGUST SURPRISE ANGER AND FEAR INDEPENDENT FROM CULTURE AND LANGUAGE . AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN EMOTIONS NOT BY CATEGORISING BUT RATHER BY MEASURING THE INTENSITY OF AN EMOTION BY IMPOSING DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS E.G . THEIR VALENCE AND THEIR AROUSAL . IF THIS THEORY WOULD BE TRUE THEN ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND DIFFERENT BRAIN REGIONS WHICH SELECTIVEY PROCESS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</pattern>
<template>One of the most influential ethnographic studies by Eckman and Friesen, which is based on the comparison of facial expressions of emotions in different cultures, concluded that there are six basic types of emotions expressed in faces - namely sadness, happiness, disgust, surprise, anger and fear, independent from culture and language. An alternative approach is to differentiate between emotions not by categorising but rather by measuring the intensity of an emotion by imposing different dimensions, e.g. their valence and their arousal. If this theory would be true then one might expect to find different brain regions which selectivey process positive or negative emotions.</template>

<pattern>THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH ARISES IS HOW TO CATEGORISE EMOTIONS . THEY COULD BE TREATED AS A SINGLE ENTITY BUT PERHAPS IT COULD EVEN MAKE MORE SENSE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM WHICH LEADS TO THE QUESTION IF SOME EMOTIONS LIKE HAPPINESS OR ANGER ARE MORE BASIC THAN OTHER TYPES LIKE JEALOUSY OR LOVE AND IF EMOTIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON CULTURE AND / OR LANGUAGE</pattern>
<template>The first question which arises is how to categorise emotions. They could be treated as a single entity, but perhaps it could even make more sense to distinguish between them, which leads to the

<pattern>ONE INTERPRETATION REGARDS EMOTIONS AS „ ACTION SCHEMES “ WHICH ESPECIALLY LEAD TO A CERTAIN BEHAVIOUR WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL . IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF EMOTION LIKE SUBJECTIVE - OFTEN BODILY - FEELINGS AS WELL AS UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS LIKE THE DETECTION OF A THREAT . THIS WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER ON IN CONJUNCTION WITH AWARENESS OF EMOTION . IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A MOOD AND AN EMOTION . A MOOD REFERS TO A SITUATION WHERE AN EMOTION OCCURS FREQUENTLY OR CONTINUOUSLY . AS AN EXAMPLE : FEAR IS AN EMOTION ANXIETY IS A MOOD</pattern>
<template>One interpretation regards emotions as „action schemes“, which especially lead to a certain behaviour which is essential for survival. It is important to distinguish between conscious aspects of emotion like subjective - often bodily - feelings, as well as unconscious aspects like the detection of a threat. This will be discussed later on in conjunction with awareness of emotion. It is also important to differentiate between a mood and an emotion. A mood refers to a situation where an emotion occurs frequently or continuously. As an example: Fear is an emotion, anxiety is a mood.</template>

<pattern>THE MOST INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT ABOUT THESE MODELS IS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO LEARN WITHOUT BEING PROVIDED SPECIFIC RULES . THIS ABILITY TO “ LEARN ” CAN BE COMPARED TO THE HUMAN ABILITY E.G . TO LEARN THE NATIVE LANGUAGE BECAUSE THERE IS NOBODY WHO TELLS ONE “ THE RULES ” IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LEARN THIS ONE . THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS LEARN BY EXTRACTING THE REGULARITY OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH REPEATED EXPOSURE . THIS EXPOSURE OCCURS THEN VIA “ TRAINING ” IN WHICH INPUT PATTERNS ARE PROVIDED OVER AND OVER AGAIN . THE ADJUSTMENT OF “ THE CONNECTION WEIGHTS BETWEEN UNITS ” AS ALREADY MENTIONED ABOVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LEARNING WITHIN THE SYSTEM . LEARNING OCCURS BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN UNITS WHICH OCCURRENCE IS THOUGHT TO BE SIMILAR IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</pattern>
<template>The most interesting and important about these models is that they are able to "learn" without being provided specific rules. This ability to “learn” can be compared to the human ability e.g. to learn the native language, because there is nobody who tells one “the rules” in order to be able to learn this one. The computational models learn by extracting the regularity of relationships with repeated exposure. This exposure occurs then via “training” in which input patterns are provided over and over again. The adjustment of “the connection weights between units” as already mentioned above is responsible for learning within the system. Learning occurs because of changes in the interrelationships between units, which occurrence is thought to be similar in the nervous system.</template>

<pattern>IN ORDER TO SIMULATE MENTAL FUNCTIONS IN HUMANS A VARIETY OF COMPUTATIONAL MODELS CAN BE USED . THE BASIC COMPONENT OF MOST SUCH MODELS IS A “ UNIT ” WHICH ONE CAN IMAGINE AS SHOWING NEURON-LIKE BEHAVIOUR . THESE UNITS RECEIVE INPUT FROM OTHER UNITS WHICH ARE SUMMED TO PRODUCE A NET INPUT . THE NET INPUT TO A UNIT IS THEN TRANSFORMED INTO THAT UNIT ’ S OUTPUT MOSTLY UTILIZING A SIGMOID FUNCTION . THESE UNITS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER FORMING LAYERS . MOST MODELS CONSIST OF AN INPUT LAYER AN OUTPUT LAYER AND A “ HIDDEN ” LAYER AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE . THE INPUT LAYER SIMULATES THE TAKING UP OF INFORMATION FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE OUTPUT LAYER SIMULATES THE RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE “ HIDDEN ” LAYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE COMPUTATION UNDER INVESTIGATION . THE UNITS OF DIFFERENT LAYERS ARE CONNECTED VIA CONNECTION WEIGHTS WHICH SHOW THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE THAT A UNIT IN ONE LEVEL HAS ON THE UNIT IN ANOTHER ONE</pattern>
<template>In order to simulate mental functions in humans, a variety of computational models can be used. The basic component of most such models is a “unit”, which one can imagine as showing neuron-like behaviour. These units receive input from other units, which are summed to produce a net input. The net input to a unit is then transformed into that unit’s output, mostly utilizing a sigmoid function. These units are connected together forming layers. Most models consist of an input layer, an output layer and a “hidden” layer as you can see on the right side.  The input layer simulates the taking up of information from the outside world, the output layer simulates the response of the system and the “hidden” layer is responsible for the transformations, which are necessary to perform the computation under investigation. The units of different layers are connected via connection weights, which show the degree of influence that a unit in one level has on the unit in another one.</template>

<template>The eye tracking is a study with a long history, starting back in the 1800s. In 1879 Louis Emile Javal noticed that reading does not involve smooth sweeping of the eye along the text but rather series of short stops which are called fixations. This observation is one of the first attempts to examine the eye’s directions of interest. The book of Alfred L. Yarbus which he published in 1967 after an important eye tracking research is one of the most quoted eye tracking publications ever. The eye tracking procedure is not that complicated. Video based eye trackers are frequently used. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records the movements while the viewer looks at some stimulus. The most modern eye trackers use contrast to locate the center of the pupil and create corneal reflections using infrared or near-infrared non-collimated light.</template>

AGE-APPROPRIATE TEST VERSIONS EXIST FOR SMALL CHILDREN FROM AGE 2 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN AND ADULTS . FOR EXAMPLE THE WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN FIFTH EDITION ( WISC-V ) MEASURES VARIOUS COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN CHILDREN BETWEEN 6 AND 16 YEARS OF AGE .

<pattern>BESIDES USING METHODS TO MEASURE THE BRAIN ’ S PHYSIOLOGY AND ANATOMY IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING BEHAVIOUR IN ORDER TO GET A BETTER INSIGHT ON COGNITION . COMPARED TO THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC METHODS WHICH CONCENTRATE ON NEURONAL ACTIVITY OF THE BRAIN REGIONS BEHAVIOURAL METHODS FOCUS ON OVERT BEHAVIOUR OF A TEST PERSON . THIS CAN BE REALIZED BY WELL DEFINED BEHAVIOURAL METHODS ( E.G . EYE-TRACKING ) TEST BATTERIES ( E.G . IQ-TEST ) OR MEASUREMENTS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE BEHAVIOUR OF HUMANS . FURTHERMORE BEHAVIOURAL METHODS ARE OFTEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH ALL KINDS OF NEUROSCIENTIFIC METHODS MENTIONED ABOVE . WHENEVER THERE IS AN OVERT REACTION ON A STIMULUS ( E.G . PICTURE ) THESE BEHAVIOURAL METHODS CAN BE USEFUL . ANOTHER GOAL OF A BEHAVIOURAL TEST IS TO EXAMINE IN WHAT TERMS DAMAGE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFLUENCES COGNITIVE ABILITIES</pattern>
<template>Besides using methods to measure the brain’s physiology and anatomy, it is also important to have techniques for analyzing behaviour in order to get a better insight on cognition. Compared to the neuroscientific methods, which concentrate on neuronal activity of the brain regions, behavioural methods focus on overt behaviour of a test person. This can be realized by well defined behavioural methods (e.g. eye-tracking), test batteries (e.g. IQ-test) or measurements which are designed to answer specific questions concerning the behaviour of humans. Furthermore, behavioural methods are often used in combination with all kinds of neuroscientific methods mentioned above. Whenever there is an overt reaction on a stimulus (e.g. picture) these behavioural methods can be useful. Another goal of a behavioural test is to examine in what terms damage of the central nervous system influences cognitive abilities.</template>

Around 1800, the so-called galvanism (it was concerned with effects of today’s electrophysiology) came up. Scientists like Giovanni Aldini experimented with electrical effects on the brain. A medical application of his findings was the treatment of melancholy. During the twentieth century among neurologists and psychiatrists electrical stimulation was a controversial but nevertheless wide spread method for the treatment of several kinds of mental disorders (e.g. Electroconvulsive therapy by Ugo Cerletti).</template>

<template>Method:
UMTS utilizes the principle of electromagnetic induction to an isolated brain region. A wire-coil electromagnet is held upon the fixed head of the subject. When inducing small, localized, and reversible changes in the living brain tissue, especially the directly under laying parts of the motor cortex can be effected. By altering the firing-patterns of the neurons, the influenced brain area is disabled. The repetitive TMS (rTMS) describes, as the name reveals, the application of many short electrical stimulations with a high frequency and is more common than TMS. The effects of this procedure last up to weeks and the method is in most cases used in combination with measuring methods, for example: to study the effects in detail.</template>

<pattern>MEG HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER EEG . FIRST MAGNETIC FIELDS ARE LESS INFLUENCED THAN ELECTRICAL CURRENTS BY CONDUCTION THROUGH BRAIN TISSUES CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID THE SKULL AND SCALP . SECOND THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD CAN TELL US INFORMATION ABOUT HOW DEEP WITHIN THE BRAIN THE SOURCE IS LOCATED . HOWEVER MEG ALSO HAS SOME DISADVANTAGES . THE MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE BRAIN IS ABOUT 100 MILLION TIMES SMALLER THAN THAT OF THE EARTH . DUE TO THIS SHIELDED ROOMS MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM ARE REQUIRED . THIS MAKES MEG MORE EXPENSIVE . ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE IS THAT MEG CANNOT DETECT ACTIVITY OF CELLS WITH CERTAIN ORIENTATIONS WITHIN THE BRAIN . FOR EXAMPLE MAGNETIC FIELDS CREATED BY CELLS WITH LONG AXES RADIAL TO THE SURFACE WILL BE INVISIBLE</pattern>
<template>MEG has some advantages over EEG. First, magnetic fields are less influenced than electrical currents by conduction through brain tissues, cerebral spinal fluid, the skull and scalp. Second, the strength of the magnetic field can tell us information about how deep within the brain the source is located. However, MEG also has some disadvantages. The magnetic field in the brain is about 100 million times smaller than that of the earth. Due to this, shielded rooms, made out of aluminum, are required. This makes MEG more expensive. Another disadvantage is that MEG cannot detect activity of cells with certain orientations within the brain. For example, magnetic fields created by cells with long axes radial to the surface will be invisible.</template>

<pattern>MEG IS MAINLY USED TO LOCALIZE THE SOURCE OF EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY AND TO LOCATE PRIMARY SENSORY CORTICES . THIS IS HELPFUL BECAUSE BY LOCATING THEM THEY CAN BE AVOIDED DURING NEUROLOGICAL INTERVENTION . FURTHERMORE MEG CAN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY UNDERLYING PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA . IN ADDITION MEG CAN ALSO BE USED TO EXAMINE A VARIETY OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES SUCH AS LANGUAGE OBJECT RECOGNITION AND SPATIAL PROCESSING AMONG OTHERS IN PEOPLE WHO ARE NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT</pattern>
<template>MEG is mainly used to localize the source of epileptic activity and to locate primary sensory cortices. This is helpful because by locating them they can be avoided during neurological intervention.
Furthermore, MEG can be used to understand more about the neurophysiology underlying psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. In addition, MEG can also be used to examine a variety of cognitive processes, such as language, object recognition and spatial processing among others, in people who are neurologically intact.</template>

<pattern>MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY ( MEG ) IS RELATED TO ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY ( EEG ) . HOWEVER INSTEAD OF RECORDING ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS ON THE SCALP IT USES MAGNETIC POTENTIALS NEAR THE SCALP TO INDEX BRAIN ACTIVITY . TO LOCATE A DIPOLE THE MAGNETIC FIELD CAN BE USED BECAUSE THE DIPOLE SHOWS EXCELLENTLY THE INTENSITY OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD . BY USING DEVICES CALLED SQUIDS ( SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE DEVICE ) ONE CAN RECORD THESE MAGNETIC FIELDS</pattern>
<template>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is related to electroencephalography (EEG). However, instead of recording electrical potentials on the scalp, it uses magnetic potentials near the scalp to index brain activity. To locate a dipole, the magnetic field can be used, because the dipole shows excellently the intensity of the magnetic field. By using devices called SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference device) one can record these magnetic fields.</template>

<pattern>THE DISADVANTAGE OF EEG IS THAT THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY AND THEREFORE THE MEASURED ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS VARY WIDELY FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND ALSO DURING TIME .

<template>The disadvantage of EEG is that the electric conductivity, and therefore the measured electrical potentials vary widely from person to person and, also during time. This is because all tissues (brain matter, blood, bones etc.) have other conductivities for electrical signals.

<pattern>SINGLE CELL STUDIES ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL FOR STUDYING THE HUMAN BRAIN SINCE IT IS TOO INVASIVE TO BE A COMMON METHOD . HENCE THIS METHOD IS MOST OFTEN USED IN ANIMALS . THERE ARE JUST A FEW CASES IN WHICH THE SINGLE-CELL RECORDING IS ALSO APPLIED IN HUMANS . PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY SOMETIMES GET REMOVED THE EPILEPTIC TISSUE . A WEEK BEFORE SURGERY ELECTRODES ARE IMPLANTED INTO THE BRAIN OR GET PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF THE BRAIN DURING THE SURGERY TO BETTER ISOLATE THE SOURCE OF SEIZURE ACTIVITY . SO USING THIS METHOD ONE CAN DECREASE THE POSSIBILITY THAT USEFUL TISSUES WILL BE REMOVED . DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS METHOD IN HUMANS THERE ARE OTHER METHODS WHICH MEASURE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY .

<template>Single cell studies are not very helpful for studying the human brain, since it is too invasive to be a common method. Hence, this method is most often used in animals. There are just a few cases in which the single-cell recording is also applied in humans. People with epilepsy sometimes get removed the epileptic tissue. A week before surgery electrodes are implanted into the brain or get placed on the surface of the brain during the surgery to better isolate the source of seizure activity. So using this method one can decrease the possibility that useful tissues will be removed. Due to the limitations of this method in humans there are other methods which measure electrical activity. Those we are going to discuss next.</template>

<pattern>WHEN USING THE SINGLE-CELL METHOD AN ELECTRODE IS PLACED INTO A CELL OF THE BRAIN ON WHICH WE WANT TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION . NOW IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE EXPERIMENTER TO RECORD THE ELECTRICAL OUTPUT OF THE CELL THAT IS CONTACTED BY THE EXPOSED ELECTRODE TIP . THAT IS USEFUL FOR STUDYING THE UNDERLYING ION CURRENTS WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CELL ’ S RESTING POTENTIAL . THE RESEARCHERS ’ GOAL IS THEN TO DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CELL RESPONDS TO SENSORY INFORMATION FROM ONLY SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE WORLD OR FROM MANY STIMULI . SO WE COULD DETERMINE WHETHER THE CELL IS SENSITIVE TO INPUT IN ONLY ONE SENSORY MODALITY OR IS MULTIMODAL IN SENSITIVITY . ONE CAN ALSO FIND OUT WHICH PROPERTIES OF A STIMULUS MAKE CELLS IN THOSE REGIONS FIRE . FURTHERMORE WE CAN FIND OUT IF THE ANIMAL ’ S ATTENTION TOWARDS A CERTAIN STIMULUS INFLUENCES IN THE CELL ’ S RESPOND</pattern>
<template>When using the single-cell method an electrode is placed into a cell of the brain on which we want to focus our attention. Now, it is possible for the experimenter to record the electrical output of the cell that is contacted by the exposed electrode tip. That is useful for studying the underlying ion currents which are responsible for the cell’s resting potential. The researchers’ goal is then to determine for example, if the cell responds to sensory information from only specific details of the world or from many stimuli. So we could determine whether the cell is sensitive to input in only one sensory modality or is multimodal in sensitivity. One can also find out which properties of a stimulus make cells in those regions fire. Furthermore we can find out if the animal’s attention towards a certain stimulus influences in the cell’s respond.</template>

THE METHODS WE DISCUSSED SO FAR DO A GREAT JOB OF IDENTIFYING WHERE ACTIVITY IS OCCURRING IN THE BRAIN . A DISADVANTAGE OF THESE METHODS IS THAT THEY DO NOT MEASURE BRAIN ACTIVITY ON A MILLISECOND-BY-MILLISECOND BASIS . THIS MEASURING CAN BE DONE BY ELECTROMAGNETIC RECORDING METHODS FOR EXAMPLE BY SINGLE-CELL RECORDING OR THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY ( EEG ) . THESE METHODS MEASURE THE BRAIN ACTIVITY REALLY FAST AND OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT THEY CAN GIVE A REALLY GOOD TEMPORAL RESOLUTION</pattern>
<template>The methods we have mentioned up to now examine the metabolic activity of the brain. But there are also other cases in which one wants to measure electrical activity of the brain or the magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity. The methods we discussed so far do a great job of identifying where activity is occurring in the brain. A disadvantage of these methods is that they do not measure brain activity on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis. This measuring can be done by electromagnetic recording methods, for example by single-cell recording or the Electroencephalography (EEG). These methods measure the brain activity really fast and over a longer period of time so that they can give a really good temporal resolution.</template>

<pattern>FMRI HAS MODERATELY GOOD SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND BAD TEMPORAL RESOLUTION SINCE ONE FMRI FRAME IS ABOUT 2 SECONDS LONG . HOWEVER THE TEMPORAL RESPONSE OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY WHICH IS THE BASIS OF FMRI IS POOR RELATIVE TO THE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT DEFINE NEURONAL COMMUNICATION . THEREFORE SOME RESEARCH GROUPS ARE WORKING AROUND THIS ISSUE BY COMBINING FMRI WITH DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY ( EEG ) OR MAGNETO ENCEPHALOGRAPHY ( MEG ) WHICH HAS MUCH HIGHER TEMPORAL RESOLUTION BUT RATHER POORER SPATIAL RESOLUTION</pattern>
<template>fMRI has moderately good spatial resolution and bad temporal resolution since one fMRI frame is about 2 seconds long. However, the temporal response of the blood supply, which is the basis of fMRI, is poor relative to the electrical signals that define neuronal communication.

<pattern>THE FMRI ( FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE ) IMAGING IS BASED ON THE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE ( NMR ) . THE WAY THIS METHOD WORKS IS THE FOLLOWING : ALL ATOMIC NUCLEI WITH AN ODD NUMBER OF PROTONS HAVE A NUCLEAR SPIN . A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD IS PUT AROUND THE TESTED OBJECT WHICH ALIGNS ALL SPINS PARALLEL OR ANTIPARALLEL TO IT . THERE IS A RESONANCE TO AN OSCILLATING MAGNETIC FIELD AT A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY WHICH CAN BE COMPUTED IN DEPENDENCE ON THE ATOM TYPE ( THE NUCLEI ’ S USUAL SPIN IS DISTURBED WHICH INDUCES A VOLTAGE S ( T ) AFTERWARDS THEY RETURN TO THE EQUILIBRIUM STATE ) . AT THIS LEVEL DIFFERENT TISSUES CAN BE IDENTIFIED BUT THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR LOCATION . CONSEQUENTLY THE MAGNETIC FIELD ’ S STRENGTH IS GRADUALLY CHANGED THEREBY THERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN FREQUENCY AND LOCATION AND WITH THE HELP OF FOURIER ANALYSIS WE CAN GET ONE-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION INFORMATION . COMBINING SEVERAL SUCH METHODS AS THE FOURIER ANALYSIS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A 3D IMAGE</pattern>
<template>The fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance) Imaging is based on the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The way this method works is the following: All atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons have a nuclear spin. A strong magnetic field is put around the tested object which aligns all spins parallel or antiparallel to it. There is a resonance to an oscillating magnetic field at a specific frequency, which can be computed in dependence on the atom type (the nuclei’s usual spin is disturbed, which induces a voltage s (t), afterwards they return to the equilibrium state). At this level different tissues can be identified, but there is no information about their location. Consequently the magnetic field’s strength is gradually changed, thereby there is a correspondence between frequency and location and with the help of Fourier analysis we can get one-dimensional location information. Combining several such methods as the Fourier analysis it is possible to get a 3D image.</template>

<template>Certainly one of the famous "lesion" cases was that of Phineas Gage.  On 13 September 1848 Gage, a railroad construction foreman, was using an iron rod to tamp an explosive charge into a body of rock when premature explosion of the charge blew the rod through his left jaw and out the top of his head. Miraculously, Gage survived, but reportedly underwent a dramatic personality change as a result of destruction of one or both of his frontal lobes. The uniqueness of Gage case (and the ethical impossibility of repeating the treatment in other patients) makes it difficult to draw generalizations from it, but it does illustrate the core idea behind the lesion method.  Further problems stem from the persistent distortions in published accounts of Gage—see the Wikipedia article Phineas Gage.</template>

Researchers attempt to correlate a specific brain area to an observed behavior by using reported experiences and research observations. Researchers may conclude that the loss of functionality in a brain region causes behavioral changes or deficits in task performance. For example, a patient with a lesion in the parietal-temporal-occipital association area will exhibit agraphia, a condition in which he/she is not able to write, despite having no deficits in motor ability. If damage to a particular brain region (structure X) is shown to correlate with a specific change in behavior (behavior Y), researchers may deduce that structure X has a relation to behavior Y.</template>

<template>Summing up, Social Cognition is a very complex skill and can be seen as the fundament of our current society. On account of the concept of Shared Intentionality, humans show by far the most sophisticated form of social cooperation. Although it may not seem obvious, Social Cognition can actually be compatible with the theory of evolution and various reasonable approaches can be formulated. These theories are all based on a rather selfish drive to pass on our genetic material - so it may be questionable, if deep-rooted altruism and completely selfless behaviour truly exists.</template>

<pattern>ASSUMING SPECIES ARE NOT ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DIFFERENT STRATEGIES BUT RATHER THAT THEIR STRATEGICAL BEHAVIOUR IS HARD-WIRED WE CAN FINALLY COME BACK TO THE EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE . IN THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION ROBERT AXELROD FORMALISED DARWIN S EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUAL ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF GAME THEORY . [ 5 ] BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF AN EVOLUTIONARY STABLE STRATEGY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRISONER S DILEMMA GAME HE SHOWED HOW COOPERATION CAN GET STARTED IN AN ASOCIAL WORLD AND CAN RESIST INVASION ONCE FULLY ESTABLISHED</pattern>
<template>Assuming species are not able to choose between different strategies, but rather that their strategical behaviour is hard-wired, we can finally come back to the evolutionary perspective. In The Evolution of Cooperation Robert Axelrod formalised Darwin's emphasis on individual advantage in terms of game theory.[5] Based on the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game he showed how cooperation can get started in an asocial world and can resist invasion once fully established.</template>

<pattern>ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES IN THE ITERATED PRISONER S DILEMMA IS THE MIXED STRATEGY CALLED TIT FOR TAT : ALWAYS COOPERATE IN THE FIRST GAME THEN DO WHATEVER YOUR OPPONENT DID IN THE PREVIOUS GAME . PLAYING TIT FOR TAT MEANS TO MAINTAIN COOPERATION AS LONG AS THE OPPONENT DOES . IF THE OPPONENT DEFECTS HE GETS PUNISHED IN SUCCEEDING GAMES BY DEFECTING LIKEWISE UNTIL COOPERATION IS RESTORED . WITH THIS STRATEGY RATIONAL PLAYERS CAN SUSTAIN THE COOPERATIVE OUTCOME AT LEAST FOR INDEFINITELY LONG GAMES ( LIKE LIFE ) . [ 4 ] CLEARLY TIT FOR TAT IS ONLY EXPECTED TO EVOLVE IN THE PRESENCE OF A MECHANISM TO IDENTIFY AND PUNISH CHEATERS</pattern>
<template>One of the most effective strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma is the mixed strategy called Tit for Tat: Always cooperate in the first game, then do whatever your opponent did in the previous game. Playing Tit for Tat means to maintain cooperation as long as the opponent does. If the opponent defects he gets punished in succeeding games by defecting likewise until cooperation is restored. With this strategy rational players can sustain the cooperative outcome at least for indefinitely long games (like life).[4] Clearly Tit for Tat is only expected to evolve in the presence of a mechanism to identify and punish cheaters.</template>

<pattern>IN MANY CASES SOCIAL INTERACTIONS CAN BE MODELLED BY THE PRISONER S DILEMMA WHICH PROVIDES THE BASIS OF OUR ANALYSIS . THE CLASSICAL PRISONER S DILEMMA IS AS FOLLOWS : KNUT AND HIS FRIEND ARE ARRESTED BY THE POLICE . THE POLICE HAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR A CONVICTION AND HAVING SEPARATED BOTH PRISONERS VISITS EACH OF THEM TO OFFER THE SAME DEAL : IF ONE TESTIFIES FOR THE PROSECUTION AGAINST THE OTHER AND THE OTHER REMAINS SILENT THE BETRAYER GOES FREE AND THE SILENT ACCOMPLICE RECEIVES THE FULL TEN-YEAR SENTENCE . IF BOTH STAY SILENT THE POLICE CAN SENTENCE BOTH PRISONERS TO ONLY SIX MONTHS IN JAIL FOR A MINOR CHARGE . IF EACH BETRAYS THE OTHER EACH WILL RECEIVE A TWO-YEAR SENTENCE</pattern>
<template>In many cases social interactions can be modelled by the Prisoner's Dilemma, which provides the basis of our analysis. The classical prisoner's dilemma is as follows: Knut and his friend are arrested by the police. The police has insufficient evidence for a conviction, and, having separated both prisoners, visits each of them to offer the same deal: if one testifies for the prosecution against the other and the other remains silent, the betrayer goes free and the silent accomplice receives the full ten-year sentence. If both stay silent, the police can sentence both prisoners to only six months in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each will receive a two-year sentence.</template>

<pattern>THE THEORY OF RECIPROCAL ALTRUISM DESCRIBES BENEFICIAL BEHAVIOUR IN EXPECTATION OF FUTURE RECIPROCITY . THIS FORM OF ALTRUISM IS NOT A SELFLESS CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS BUT IT DENOTES MUTUAL COOPERATION OF REPEATEDLY INTERACTING SPECIES IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE THEIR INDIVIDUAL UTILITY . IN SOCIAL LIFE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN BENEFIT FROM MUTUAL COOPERATION BUT EACH ONE CAN ALSO DO EVEN BETTER BY EXPLOITING THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF OTHERS . GAME THEORY ALLOWS A FORMALISATION OF THE STRATEGIC POSSIBILITIES IN SUCH SITUATIONS . IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT ALTRUISTIC BEHAVIOUR CAN BE MORE SUCCESSFUL ( IN TERMS OF UTILITY ) THAN PURELY SELF-INTERESTED STRATEGIES AND THEREFORE WILL LEAD TO BETTER FITNESS AND SURVIVABILITY</pattern>
<template>The theory of Reciprocal Altruism describes beneficial behaviour in expectation of future reciprocity. This form of altruism is not a selfless concern for the welfare of others but it denotes mutual cooperation of repeatedly interacting species in order to maximise their individual utility. In social life an individual can benefit from mutual cooperation, but each one can also do even better by exploiting the cooperative efforts of others. Game Theory allows a formalisation of the strategic possibilities in such situations. It can be shown, that altruistic behaviour can be more successful (in terms of utility) than purely self-interested strategies and therefore will lead to better fitness and survivability.</template>

<pattern>ACCORDING TO HAMILTON S RULE ALTRUISM IS ONLY FAVOURED IF DIRECTED TOWARDS RELATIVES THAT IS R > 0 { \ DISPLAYSTYLE R > 0 } . THEREFORE KIN SELECTION THEORY ACCOUNTS ONLY FOR GENETIC RELATIVES . ALTRUISM HOWEVER OCCURS AMONG NOT RELATED INDIVIDUALS AS WELL . THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED BY THE THEORY OF RECIPROCAL ALTRUISM</pattern>

<pattern>EXAMPLES FOR KIN-SELECTED ALTRUISM CAN BE FOUND IN POPULATIONS OF SOCIAL INSECTS LIKE ANTS TERMITES OR BEES . AN ANT COLONY FOR INSTANCE CONSISTS OF ONE FERTILE QUEEN AND SEVERAL HUNDREDS OR MORE OF STERILE FEMALE WORKERS . WHILE THE QUEEN IS THE ONLY ONE REPRODUCING THE WORKERS ARE AMONG OTHER THINGS RESPONSIBLE FOR BROOD CARE . THE WORKERS ARE GENETICALLY CLOSER RELATED TO THE SISTERS THEY RAISE ( 75 % ) THAN THEY WOULD BE TO THEIR OWN OFFSPRING ( 50 % ) . THEREFORE THEY ARE PASSING ON MORE OF THEIR GENES THAN IF THEY BRED ON THEIR OWN</pattern>
<template>Examples for kin-selected altruism can be found in populations of social insects like ants, termites or bees. An ant colony, for instance, consists of one fertile queen and several hundreds or more of sterile female workers. While the queen is the only one reproducing, the workers are among other things responsible for brood care. The workers are genetically closer related to the sisters they raise (75%) than they would be to their own offspring (50%). Therefore, they are passing on more of their genes than if they bred on their own.</template>

<pattern>SINCE ALTRUISTIC POPULATIONS ARE VULNERABLE TO CHEATERS THERE MUST EXIST A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS ALTRUISM TO BE MAINTAINED BY NATURAL SELECTION . THE KIN SELECTION APPROACH PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION HOW ALTRUISTIC GENES CAN SPREAD WITHOUT BEING ELIMINATED BY SELFISH BEHAVIOUR . THE THEORY WAS DEVELOPED BY WILLIAM D . HAMILTON AND JOHN M . SMITH IN 1964 . [ 3 ] THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF KIN SELECTION IS TO BENEFIT SOMEBODY WHO IS GENETICALLY RELATED FOR EXAMPLE BY SHARING FOOD . FOR THE ALTRUISTIC INDIVIDUAL THIS MEANS A REDUCTION OF ITS OWN FITNESS BY INCREASING THE FITNESS OF ITS RELATIVE . HOWEVER THE CLOSER THE RECIPIENT IS RELATED TO THE ALTRUIST THE MORE LIKELY HE SHARES THE ALTRUISTIC GENES . THE LOSS OF FITNESS CAN BE COMPENSATED SINCE THE GENES OF THE ALTRUISTICALLY BEHAVING AGENT HAVE THEN THE CHANCE TO BE SPREAD INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE RECIPIENT : THE RELATIVE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE AND PASS THE ALTRUISTIC GENES OVER TO THE NEXT GENERATION</pattern>
<template>Since altruistic populations are vulnerable to cheaters, there must exist a mechanism that allows altruism to be maintained by natural selection. The Kin Selection approach provides an explanation how altruistic genes can spread without being eliminated by selfish behaviour. The theory was developed by William D. Hamilton and John M. Smith in 1964.[3] The basic principle of Kin Selection is to benefit somebody who is genetically related, for example by sharing food. For the altruistic individual, this means a reduction of its own fitness by increasing the fitness of its relative. However, the closer the recipient is related to the altruist, the more likely he shares the altruistic genes. The loss of fitness can be compensated since the genes of the altruistically behaving agent have then the chance to be spread indirectly through the recipient: The relative might be able to reproduce and pass the altruistic genes over to the next generation.</template>

<pattern>THIS INDICATES THE PROBLEM OF THE GROUP SELECTION : IT NEEDS CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO DESCRIBE THINGS PROPERLY . ADDITIONALLY EVERY THEORY ABOUT GROUPS SHOULD INCLUDE THE PHENOMENON OF MIGRATION . SO IN THIS SIMPLE FORM THE THEORY IS NOT CAPABLE OF HANDLING SELFISH BEHAVIOUR OF SOME AGENTS IN ALTRUISTIC GROUPS : ALTRUISTIC GROUPS WHICH INCLUDE SELFISH MEMBERS WOULD TURN INTO PURE SELFISH ONES OVER TIME BECAUSE ALTRUISTIC AGENTS WOULD WORK FOR SELFISH AGENTS THEREBY INCREASING THE CHEATERS FITNESS WHILE DECREASING THEIR OWN . THUS GROUP SELECTION MAY NOT BE A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL COGNITION</pattern>
<template>This indicates the problem of the Group Selection: it needs certain circumstances to describe things properly. Additionally, every theory about groups should include the phenomenon of migration. So in this simple form, the theory is not capable of handling selfish behaviour of some agents in altruistic groups: Altruistic groups which include selfish members would turn into pure selfish ones over time, because altruistic agents would work for selfish agents, thereby increasing the cheaters' fitness while decreasing their own. Thus, Group Selection may not be a sufficient explanation for the development of Social Cognition.</template>

<pattern>VERO WYNNE-EDWARDS FIRST PROPOSED THIS THEORY IN THE 1960S . FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE A GROUP IS A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH AFFECT THE FITNESS OF EACH OTHER . GROUP SELECTION MEANS THAT IF ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF A GROUP IS DOING BENEFIT TO ITS GROUP THE GROUP IS MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND PASS ON ITS PREDISPOSITION TO THE NEXT GENERATION . THIS AGAIN IMPROVES THE CHANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO SPREAD ITS GENETIC MATERIAL . SO IN THIS THEORY A SOCIAL ORGANISM IS MORE LIKELY TO SPREAD ITS GENES THAN A SELFISH ORGANISM . THE DISTINCTION TO THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS THAT NOT ONLY THE FITTEST INDIVIDUALS ARE LIKELY TO SURVIVE BUT ALSO THE FITTEST GROUPS</pattern>
<template>Vero Wynne-Edwards first proposed this theory in the 1960s. From an evolutionary perspective, a group is a number of individuals which affect the fitness of each other. Group Selection means that if any of the individuals of a group is doing benefit to its group, the group is more likely to survive and pass on its predisposition to the next generation. This again improves the chance of the individual to spread its genetic material. So in this theory a social organism is more likely to spread its genes than a selfish organism. The distinction to the classical theory of evolution is that not only the fittest individuals are likely to survive, but also the fittest groups.</template>

<pattern>DIALOGIC COGNITIVE REPRESENTATIONS ARE CLOSELY RELATED WITH THE COMMUNICATION AND USE OF LINGUISTIC SYMBOLS . THEY ALLOW IN SOME SENSE A FORM OF COLLECTIVE INTENTIONALITY WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO CONSTRUCT SOCIAL NORMS CONCEPTUALIZE BELIEFS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SHARE THEM . IN COMPLEX SOCIAL GROUPS THE REPEATED SHARING OF INTENTIONS IN A PARTICULAR INTERACTIVE CONTEXT LEADS TO THE CREATION OF HABITUAL SOCIAL PRACTICES AND BELIEFS . THAT MAY FORM NORMATIVE OR STRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF A SOCIETY LIKE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARRIAGE ETC . SOCIETY MIGHT HENCE BE SEEN AS A PRODUCT AND AN INDICATOR OF SOCIAL COGNITION</pattern>
<template>Dialogic cognitive representations are closely related with the communication and use of linguistic symbols. They allow in some sense a form of collective intentionality, which is important to construct social norms, conceptualize beliefs and, most importantly, share them. In complex social groups the repeated sharing of intentions in a particular interactive context leads to the creation of habitual social practices and beliefs. That may form normative or structural aspects of a society, like government, money, marriage, etc. Society might hence be seen as a product and an indicator of Social Cognition.</template>

<pattern>THE STRICTLY HUMAN FACULTY TO PARTICIPATE IN COLLABORATIVE ACTIONS THAT INVOLVE SHARED GOALS AND SOCIALLY COORDINATED ACTION PLANS IS ALSO CALLED JOINT INTENTION . THIS REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOALS AND PERCEPTIONS OF OTHER INVOLVED AGENTS AS WELL AS SHARING AND COMMUNICATING THESE WHICH AGAIN SEEMS TO BE A STRICTLY HUMAN BEHAVIOUR . DUE TO OUR SPECIAL MOTIVATION TO SHARE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES WE ALSO NEED CERTAIN COMPLEX COGNITIVE REPRESENTATIONS . THESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE CALLED DIALOGIC COGNITIVE REPRESENTATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AS CONTENT MOSTLY SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT . THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE CONCEPT OF JOINT INTENTIONS SINCE WE NEED NOT ONLY A REPRESENTATION FOR OUR OWN ACTION PLAN BUT ALSO FOR OUR PARTNER S PLAN . JOINT INTENTIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF SHARED INTENTIONALITY</pattern>
<template>The strictly human faculty to participate in collaborative actions that involve shared goals and socially coordinated action plans is also called Joint Intention. This requires an understanding of the goals and perceptions of other involved agents, as well as sharing and communicating these, which again seems to be a strictly human behaviour. Due to our special motivation to share psychological states, we also need certain complex cognitive representations. These representations are called dialogic cognitive representations, because they have as content mostly social engagement. This is especially important for the concept of joint intentions, since we need not only a representation for our own action plan, but also for our partner's plan. Joint Intentions are an essential part of Shared Intentionality.</template>

AMONG THESE ABILITIES UNDERSTANDING THE INTENTION OF OTHERS IS CRUCIAL . IT ALLOWS US TO RESOLVE POSSIBLE AMBIGUITIES OF PHYSICAL ACTIONS .

HE WOULD NEED TO BE JUDGED DIFFERENTLY IF HE HAD LOST HIS CAR KEYS AND IT WAS HIS OWN CAR THAT HE WAS TRYING TO BREAK INTO . HUMANS ALSO COLLABORATE AND INTERACT CULTURALLY . WE PERFORM COMPLEX COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES LIKE BUILDING A HOUSE TOGETHER OR PLAYING FOOTBALL AS A TEAM . OVER TIME THIS LED TO POWERFUL CONCEPTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS LIKE SOCIETIES AND STATES . THE REASON FOR THIS INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE CONCEPT OF SHARED INTENTIONALITY</pattern>
<template>Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others. That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or desire. Among these abilities, understanding the intention of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions. For example, if you were to see someone breaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger's car. He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into. Humans also collaborate and interact culturally. We perform complex collaborative activities, like building a house together or playing football as a team. Over time this led to powerful concepts of organizational levels like societies and states. The reason for this intense development can be traced back to the concept of Shared Intentionality.</template>

Chase and Simon concluded that the superior performance on actual game positions was due to the ability to recognise familiar patterns: A chess expert has up to 50,000 patterns stored in his memory. In comparison, a good player might know about 1,000 patterns by heart and a novice only few to none at all.
This very detailed knowledge is of crucial help when an expert is confronted with a new problem in his field. Still, it is not pure size of knowledge that makes an expert more successful. Experts also organise their knowledge quite differently from novices.</template>

<pattern>HERE THE STORY ABOUT THE GENERAL IS THE SOURCE PROBLEM AND THE RADIATION PROBLEM IS THE TARGET PROBLEM . THE FORTRESS IS ANALOGOUS TO THE TUMOUR AND THE BIG ARMY CORRESPONDS TO THE HIGHLY INTENSIVE RAY . CONSEQUENTLY A SMALL GROUP OF SOLDIERS REPRESENTS A RAY AT LOW INTENSITY . THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IS TO SPLIT THE RAY UP AS THE GENERAL DID WITH HIS ARMY AND SEND THE NOW HARMLESS RAYS TOWARDS THE TUMOUR FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ALL MEET WHEN REACHING IT . NO HEALTHY TISSUE IS DAMAGED BUT THE TUMOUR ITSELF GETS DESTROYED BY THE RAY AT ITS FULL INTENSITY</pattern>
<template>Here, the story about the General is the source problem, and the radiation problem is the target problem. The fortress is analogous to the tumour and the big army corresponds to the highly intensive ray. Consequently a small group of soldiers represents a ray at low intensity. The solution to the problem is to split the ray up, as the general did with his army, and send the now harmless rays towards the tumour from different angles in such a way that they all meet when reaching it. No healthy tissue is damaged but the tumour itself gets destroyed by the ray at its full intensity.</template>

<category>
<pattern>TO SHOW THAT SOLVING INSIGHT PROBLEMS INVOLVES RESTRUCTURING PSYCHOLOGISTS CREATED A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT WERE MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE FOR PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED WITH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES SINCE IT WAS HARDER FOR THEM TO CHANGE THE REPRESENTATION OF THE GIVEN SITUATION ( SEE FIXATION ) .

ALTHOUGH SUCH HELP IS NOT OBVIOUSLY A HINT THE EFFECT DOES NOT DIFFER FROM THAT OF INTENDED HELP</pattern>
<template>To show that solving insight problems involves restructuring, psychologists created a number of problems that were more difficult to solve for participants provided with previous experiences, since it was harder for them to change the representation of the given situation (see Fixation). Sometimes  given hints may lead to the insight required to solve the problem. And this is also true for involuntarily given ones. For instance it might help you to solve a memory game if someone accidentally drops a card on the floor and you look at the other side. Although such help is not obviously a hint, the effect does not differ from that of intended help.</template>

AT ONE TIME YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY IDEAS OF THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM YOU DO NOT EVEN FEEL TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS TRYING OUT DIFFERENT IDEAS BUT IN THE NEXT SECOND THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED</pattern>
<template>Tasks that might involve insight usually have certain features – they require something new and non-obvious to be done and in most cases they are difficult enough to predict that the initial solution attempt will be unsuccessful. When you solve a problem of this kind you often have a so called "AHA-experience" – the solution pops up all of a sudden. At one time you do not have any ideas of  the answer to the problem, you do not even feel to make any progress trying out different ideas, but in the next second the problem is solved.</template>

<template>Newer methods, like EEG and fMRI etc. allow researchers to correlate the behaviour of a participant in an experiment with the brain activity which is measured simultaneously. It is possible to record neurophysiological responses to certain stimuli or to find out which brain areas are involved in the execution of certain mental tasks. EEG measures the electric potentials along the skull through electrodes that are attached to a cap. While its spatial resolution is not very precise, the temporal
resolution lies within the range of milliseconds. The use of fMRI benefits from the fact the increased brain activity goes along with increased blood flow in the active region. The haemoglobin in the blood has magnetic properties that are registered by the fMRI scanner. The spatial resolution of fMRI is very precise in comparison to EEG. On the other hand, the temporal resolution is in the range of just 1–2 seconds.</template>

NEUROSCIENCE COMPRISES THE STUDY OF NEUROANATOMY NEUROPHYSIOLOGY BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND COMPUTER BASED MODELS .

<template>Of course it would be very convenient if we could understand the nature of cognition without the nature of the brain itself. But unfortunately it is very difficult if not impossible to build and prove theories about our thinking in absence of neurobiological constraints. Neuroscience comprises the study of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, brain functions and related psychological and computer based models. For years, investigations on a neuronal level were completely separated from those on a cognitive or psychological level. The thinking process is so vast and complex that there are too many conceivable solutions to the problem of how cognitive operation could be accomplished.</template>

<template>Newer methods, like Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have given researchers the possibility to measure brain activity and possibly correlate it to mental states and processes. All these new approaches in the study of human cognition and psychology have defined the field of Cognitive Psychology, a very fascinating field which tries to answer what is quite possibly the most interesting question posed since the dawn of reason. There is still a lot to discover and to answer and to ask again, but first we want to make you more familiar with the concept of Cognitive Psychology.</template>

<template>If more about the ways humans process information was understood, it would be much simpler to build artificial structures, which have the same or similar abilities. The area of cognitive development investigation tried to describe how children develop their cognitive abilities from infancy to adolescence. The theories of knowledge representation were first strongly concerned with sensory inputs. Current scientists claim to have evidence that our internal representation of reality is not a one-to-one reproduction of the physical world. It is rather stored in some abstract or neurochemical code. Tolman, Bartlett, Norman and Rumelhart made some experiments on cognitive mapping. Here, the inner knowledge seemed not only to be related to sensory input, but also to be modified by some kind of knowledge network modeled by past experience.</template>

<template>Neuroinformatics, which is based on the natural structure of the human nervous system, tries to build neuronal structures by the idea of artificial neurons. In addition to that, Neuroinformatics is used as a field of evidence for psychological models, for example models for memory. The artificial neuron network “learns” words and behaves like “real” neurons in the brain. If the results of the artificial neuron network are quite similar to the results of real memory experiments, it would support the model. In this way psychological models can be “tested”. Furthermore it would help to build artificial neuron networks, which posses similar skills like the human such as face recognition.</template>

Behaviourists like Burrhus Frederic Skinner claimed that such mental internal operations - such as attention, memory, and thinking – are only hypothetical constructs that cannot be observed or proven.  Therefore, Behaviorists asserted, mental constructs are not as important and relevant as the study and experimental analysis of behaviour (directly observable data) in response to some stimulus. According to Watson and Skinner, man could be objectively studied only in this way. The popularity of Behavioralist theory in the psychological world led investigation of mental events and processes to be abandoned for about 50 years.</template>

<template>Knut has a problem; he really needs to do his assignment. To solve this problem, he has to perform loads of cognition. The light reaching his eyes is transduced into electrical signals traveling through several stations to his visual cortex. Meanwhile, complex nets of neurons filter the information flow and compute contrast, colour, patterns, positions in space, motion of the objects in Knut's environment. Stains and lines on the screen become words; words get meaning; the meaning is put into context; analyzed on its relevance for Knut's problem and finally maybe stored in some part of his memory. At the same time an appetite for sweets is creeping from Knut's hypothalamus, a region in the brain responsible for controlling the needs of an organism.

<template>If a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is a strong form of abstraction or information hiding known as abstraction.  Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the private keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the public keyword.  Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as protected (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class).  In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, private methods may have names that start with an underscore).</template>

<template>In prototype-based languages the objects are the primary entities. No classes even exist. The prototype of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one prototype link (and only one).  New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects apple and orange a fruit, if the object fruit exists, and both apple and orange have fruit as their prototype. The idea of the fruit class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the equivalence class of the objects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the prototype are delegated to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods owned individually by the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attribute sugar_content may be unexpectedly not present in apple.

<template>Objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack.  They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor.  A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently.

<template>In the early and mid-1990s object-oriented programming developed as the dominant programming paradigm when programming languages supporting the techniques became widely available. These included Visual FoxPro 3.0,[12][13][14] C++,[15] and Delphi[citation needed]. Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of graphical user interfaces, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the Cocoa frameworks on Mac OS X, written in Objective-C, an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of event-driven programming (although this concept is not limited to OOP).</template>

<template>In the 1970s, Smalltalk influenced the Lisp community to incorporate object-based techniques that were introduced to developers via the Lisp machine. Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such as LOOPS and Flavors introducing multiple inheritance and mixins) eventually led to the Common Lisp Object System, which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a Meta-object protocol. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the Intel iAPX 432 and the Linn Smart Rekursiv.</template>

<pattern>A CARDINAL INVARIANT IS A PROPERTY OF THE REAL LINE MEASURED BY A CARDINAL NUMBER . FOR EXAMPLE A WELL-STUDIED INVARIANT IS THE SMALLEST CARDINALITY OF A COLLECTION OF MEAGRE SETS OF REALS WHOSE UNION IS THE ENTIRE REAL LINE . THESE ARE INVARIANTS IN THE SENSE THAT ANY TWO ISOMORPHIC MODELS OF SET THEORY MUST GIVE THE SAME CARDINAL FOR EACH INVARIANT . MANY CARDINAL INVARIANTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND RELATED TO AXIOMS OF SET THEORY</pattern>
<template>A cardinal invariant is a property of the real line measured by a cardinal number. For example, a well-studied invariant is the smallest cardinality of a collection of meagre sets of reals whose union is the entire real line. These are invariants in the sense that any two isomorphic models of set theory must give the same cardinal for each invariant. Many cardinal invariants have been studied, and the relationships between them are often complex and related to axioms of set theory.</template>

<pattern>PAUL COHEN INVENTED THE METHOD OF FORCING WHILE SEARCHING FOR A MODEL OF ZFC IN WHICH THE CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS FAILS OR A MODEL OF ZF IN WHICH THE AXIOM OF CHOICE FAILS . FORCING ADJOINS TO SOME GIVEN MODEL OF SET THEORY ADDITIONAL SETS IN ORDER TO CREATE A LARGER MODEL WITH PROPERTIES DETERMINED ( I.E . FORCED ) BY THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE ORIGINAL MODEL . FOR EXAMPLE COHEN S CONSTRUCTION ADJOINS ADDITIONAL SUBSETS OF THE NATURAL NUMBERS WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE CARDINAL NUMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL . FORCING IS ALSO ONE OF TWO METHODS FOR PROVING RELATIVE CONSISTENCY BY FINITISTIC METHODS THE OTHER METHOD BEING BOOLEAN-VALUED MODELS</pattern>
<template>Paul Cohen invented the method of forcing while searching for a model of ZFC in which the continuum hypothesis fails, or a model of ZF in which the axiom of choice fails. Forcing adjoins to some given model of set theory additional sets in order to create a larger model with properties determined (i.e. "forced") by the construction and the original model. For example, Cohen's construction adjoins additional subsets of the natural numbers without changing any of the cardinal numbers of the original model. Forcing is also one of two methods for proving relative consistency by finitistic methods, the other method being Boolean-valued models.</template>

<pattern>DETERMINACY REFERS TO THE FACT THAT UNDER APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS CERTAIN TWO-PLAYER GAMES OF PERFECT INFORMATION ARE DETERMINED FROM THE START IN THE SENSE THAT ONE PLAYER MUST HAVE A WINNING STRATEGY . THE EXISTENCE OF THESE STRATEGIES HAS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES IN DESCRIPTIVE SET THEORY AS THE ASSUMPTION THAT A BROADER CLASS OF GAMES IS DETERMINED OFTEN IMPLIES THAT A BROADER CLASS OF SETS WILL HAVE A TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTY . THE AXIOM OF DETERMINACY ( AD ) IS AN IMPORTANT OBJECT OF STUDY ; ALTHOUGH INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE AXIOM OF CHOICE AD IMPLIES THAT ALL SUBSETS OF THE REAL LINE ARE WELL BEHAVED ( IN PARTICULAR MEASURABLE AND WITH THE PERFECT SET PROPERTY ) . AD CAN BE USED TO PROVE THAT THE WADGE DEGREES HAVE AN ELEGANT STRUCTURE</pattern>
<template>Determinacy refers to the fact that, under appropriate assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start in the sense that one player must have a winning strategy. The existence of these strategies has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The axiom of determinacy (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well behaved (in particular, measurable and with the perfect set property). AD can be used to prove that the Wadge degrees have an elegant structure.</template>

THESE PROPERTIES TYPICALLY IMPLY THE CARDINAL NUMBER MUST BE VERY LARGE WITH THE EXISTENCE OF A CARDINAL WITH THE SPECIFIED PROPERTY UNPROVABLE IN ZERMELO – FRAENKEL SET THEORY</pattern>
<template>A large cardinal is a cardinal number with an extra property. Many such properties are studied, including inaccessible cardinals, measurable cardinals, and many more. These properties typically imply the cardinal number must be very large, with the existence of a cardinal with the specified property unprovable in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.</template>

<pattern>AN INNER MODEL OF ZERMELO – FRAENKEL SET THEORY ( ZF ) IS A TRANSITIVE CLASS THAT INCLUDES ALL THE ORDINALS AND SATISFIES ALL THE AXIOMS OF ZF . THE CANONICAL EXAMPLE IS THE CONSTRUCTIBLE UNIVERSE L DEVELOPED BY GÖDEL . ONE REASON THAT THE STUDY OF INNER MODELS IS OF INTEREST IS THAT IT CAN BE USED TO PROVE CONSISTENCY RESULTS . FOR EXAMPLE IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A MODEL V OF ZF SATISFIES THE CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS OR THE AXIOM OF CHOICE THE INNER MODEL L CONSTRUCTED INSIDE THE ORIGINAL MODEL WILL SATISFY BOTH THE GENERALIZED CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS AND THE AXIOM OF CHOICE . THUS THE ASSUMPTION THAT ZF IS CONSISTENT ( HAS AT LEAST ONE MODEL ) IMPLIES THAT ZF TOGETHER WITH THESE TWO PRINCIPLES IS CONSISTENT</pattern>
<template>An inner model of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is a transitive class that includes all the ordinals and satisfies all the axioms of ZF. The canonical example is the constructible universe L developed by Gödel.
One reason that the study of inner models is of interest is that it can be used to prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model V of ZF satisfies the continuum hypothesis or the axiom of choice, the inner model L constructed inside the original model will satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.</template>

<pattern>IN SET THEORY AS CANTOR DEFINED AND ZERMELO AND FRAENKEL AXIOMATIZED AN OBJECT IS EITHER A MEMBER OF A SET OR NOT . IN FUZZY SET THEORY THIS CONDITION WAS RELAXED BY LOTFI A . ZADEH SO AN OBJECT HAS A DEGREE OF MEMBERSHIP IN A SET A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 . FOR EXAMPLE THE DEGREE OF MEMBERSHIP OF A PERSON IN THE SET OF TALL PEOPLE IS MORE FLEXIBLE THAN A SIMPLE YES OR NO ANSWER AND CAN BE A REAL NUMBER SUCH AS 0.75</pattern>
<template>In set theory as Cantor defined and Zermelo and Fraenkel axiomatized, an object is either a member of a set or not. In fuzzy set theory this condition was relaxed by Lotfi A. Zadeh so an object has a degree of membership in a set, a number between 0 and 1. For example, the degree of membership of a person in the set of "tall people" is more flexible than a simple yes or no answer and can be a real number such as 0.75.</template>

It begins with the study of pointclasses in the Borel hierarchy and extends to the study of more complex hierarchies such as the projective hierarchy and the Wadge hierarchy.

The work of analysts, such as that of Henri Lebesgue, demonstrated the great mathematical utility of set theory, which has since become woven into the fabric of modern mathematics. Set theory is commonly used as a foundational system, although in some areas—such as algebraic geometry and algebraic topology—category theory is thought to be a preferred foundation.</template>

<template>Participants were given 3 minutes to respond to each riddle, before the answer to the riddle was revealed. If the participant experienced an Aha! moment upon viewing the correct answer, any brain activity would be recorded on the fMRI.[25]
The fMRI results for this study showed that when participants were given the answer to an unsolved riddle, the activity in their right hippocampus increased significantly during these Aha! moments. This increased activity in the right hippocampus may be attributed to the formation of new associations between old nodes.[25] These new associations will in turn strengthen memory for the riddles and their solutions.</template>

<pattern>THE EFFECT IS NAMED FROM A STORY ABOUT ANCIENT GREEK POLYMATH ARCHIMEDES . IN THE STORY ARCHIMEDES WAS ASKED ( C . 250 BC ) BY THE LOCAL KING TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CROWN WAS PURE GOLD . DURING A SUBSEQUENT TRIP TO A PUBLIC BATH ARCHIMEDES NOTED THAT WATER WAS DISPLACED WHEN HIS BODY SANK INTO THE BATH AND PARTICULARLY THAT THE VOLUME OF WATER DISPLACED EQUALED THE VOLUME OF HIS BODY IMMERSED IN THE WATER . HAVING DISCOVERED HOW TO MEASURE THE VOLUME OF AN IRREGULAR OBJECT AND CONCEIVING OF A METHOD TO SOLVE THE KING S PROBLEM ARCHIMEDES ALLEGEDLY LEAPED OUT AND RAN HOME NAKED SHOUTING ΕὝΡΗΚΑ ( EUREKA I HAVE FOUND IT ! ) . THIS STORY IS NOW THOUGHT TO BE FICTIONAL BECAUSE IT WAS FIRST MENTIONED BY THE ROMAN WRITER VITRUVIUS NEARLY 200 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ALLEGED EVENT AND BECAUSE THE METHOD DESCRIBED BY VITRUVIUS WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED . [ 8 ] HOWEVER ARCHIMEDES CERTAINLY DID IMPORTANT ORIGINAL WORK IN HYDROSTATICS NOTABLY IN HIS ON FLOATING BODIES</pattern>
<template>The effect is named from a story about ancient Greek polymath Archimedes. In the story, Archimedes was asked (c. 250 BC) by the local king to determine whether a crown was pure gold. During a subsequent trip to a public bath, Archimedes noted that water was displaced when his body sank into the bath, and particularly that the volume of water displaced equaled the volume of his body immersed in the water. Having discovered how to measure the volume of an irregular object, and conceiving of a method to solve the king's problem, Archimedes allegedly leaped out and ran home naked, shouting εὕρηκα (eureka, "I have found it!"). This story is now thought to be fictional, because it was first mentioned by the Roman writer Vitruvius nearly 200 years after the date of the alleged event, and because the method described by Vitruvius would not have worked.[8] However, Archimedes certainly did important, original work in hydrostatics, notably in his On Floating Bodies.</template>

<pattern>INSIGHT CAN BE CONCEPTUALIZED AS A TWO PHASE PROCESS . THE FIRST PHASE OF AN AHA ! EXPERIENCE REQUIRES THE PROBLEM SOLVER TO COME UPON AN IMPASSE WHERE THEY BECOME STUCK AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY SEEMINGLY HAVE EXPLORED ALL THE POSSIBILITIES ARE STILL UNABLE TO RETRIEVE OR GENERATE A SOLUTION . THE SECOND PHASE OCCURS SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY . AFTER A BREAK IN MENTAL FIXATION OR RE-EVALUATING THE PROBLEM THE ANSWER IS RETRIEVED . [ 6 ] SOME RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT INSIGHT PROBLEMS ARE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE BECAUSE OF OUR MENTAL FIXATION ON THE INAPPROPRIATE ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM CONTENT . [ 7 ] IN ORDER TO SOLVE INSIGHT PROBLEMS ONE MUST THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX . IT IS THIS ELABORATE REHEARSAL THAT MAY CAUSE PEOPLE TO HAVE BETTER MEMORY FOR AHA ! MOMENTS . INSIGHT IS BELIEVED TO OCCUR WITH A BREAK IN MENTAL FIXATION ALLOWING THE SOLUTION TO APPEAR TRANSPARENT AND OBVIOUS</pattern>
<template>Insight can be conceptualized as a two phase process. The first phase of an Aha! experience requires the problem solver to come upon an impasse, where they become stuck and even though they may seemingly have explored all the possibilities, are still unable to retrieve or generate a solution. The second phase occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. After a break in mental fixation or re-evaluating the problem, the answer is retrieved.[6] Some research suggest that insight problems are difficult to solve because of our mental fixation on the inappropriate aspects of the problem content.[7] In order to solve insight problems, one must "think outside the box". It is this elaborate rehearsal that may cause people to have better memory for Aha! moments. Insight is believed to occur with a break in mental fixation, allowing the solution to appear transparent and obvious.</template>

<pattern>OPERATOR OVERLOADING HAS OFTEN BEEN CRITICIZED [ 2 ] BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PROGRAMMERS TO REASSIGN THE SEMANTICS OF OPERATORS DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF THEIR OPERANDS . FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE < < OPERATOR IN C + + A < < B SHIFTS THE BITS IN THE VARIABLE A LEFT BY B BITS IF A AND B ARE OF AN INTEGER TYPE BUT IF A IS AN OUTPUT STREAM THEN THE ABOVE CODE WILL ATTEMPT TO WRITE A B TO THE STREAM . BECAUSE OPERATOR OVERLOADING ALLOWS THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMMER TO CHANGE THE USUAL SEMANTICS OF AN OPERATOR AND TO CATCH ANY SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMERS BY SURPRISE IT IS CONSIDERED GOOD PRACTICE TO USE OPERATOR OVERLOADING WITH CARE ( THE CREATORS OF JAVA DECIDED NOT TO USE THIS FEATURE [ 3 ] ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY FOR THIS REASON )</pattern>
<template>Operator overloading has often been criticized[2] because it allows programmers to reassign the semantics of operators depending on the types of their operands. For example, the use of the << operator in C++ a << b shifts the bits in the variable a left by b bits if a and b are of an integer type, but if a is an output stream then the above code will attempt to write a b to the stream. Because operator overloading allows the original programmer to change the usual semantics of an operator and to catch any subsequent programmers by surprise, it is considered good practice to use operator overloading with care (the creators of Java decided not to use this feature,[3] although not necessarily for this reason).</template>

<template>Propositions show up in modern formal logic as sentences of a formal language. A formal language begins with different types of symbols. These types can include variables, operators, function symbols, predicate (or relation) symbols, quantifiers, and propositional constants.(Grouping symbols such as delimiters are often added for convenience in using the language, but do not play a logical role.) Symbols are concatenated together according to recursive rules, in order to construct strings to which truth-values will be assigned. The rules specify how the operators, function and predicate symbols, and quantifiers are to be concatenated with other strings. A proposition is then a string with a specific form. The form that a proposition takes depends on the type of logic.</template>

<template>In relation to the mind, propositions are discussed primarily as they fit into propositional attitudes. Propositional attitudes are simply attitudes characteristic of folk psychology (belief, desire, etc.) that one can take toward a proposition (e.g. 'it is raining,' 'snow is white,' etc.). In English, propositions usually follow folk psychological attitudes by a "that clause" (e.g. "Jane believes that it is raining"). In philosophy of mind and psychology, mental states are often taken to primarily consist in propositional attitudes. The propositions are usually said to be the "mental content" of the attitude. For example, if Jane has a mental state of believing that it is raining, her mental content is the proposition 'it is raining.' Furthermore, since such mental states are about something (namely, propositions), they are said to be intentional mental states.</template>

<pattern>IN PRINCIPLE PROVING A STATEMENT TRUE OR FALSE CAN BE SHOWN TO BE EQUIVALENT TO PROVING THAT THE NUMBER MATCHING THE STATEMENT DOES OR DOESN T HAVE A GIVEN PROPERTY . BECAUSE THE FORMAL SYSTEM IS STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT REASONING ABOUT NUMBERS IN GENERAL IT CAN SUPPORT REASONING ABOUT NUMBERS THAT REPRESENT FORMULAE AND STATEMENTS AS WELL . CRUCIALLY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM CAN SUPPORT REASONING ABOUT PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS THE RESULTS ARE EQUIVALENT TO REASONING ABOUT PROVABILITY OF THEIR EQUIVALENT STATEMENTS</pattern>
<template>In principle, proving a statement true or false can be shown to be equivalent to proving that the number matching the statement does or doesn't have a given property. Because the formal system is strong enough to support reasoning about numbers in general, it can support reasoning about numbers that represent formulae and statements as well. Crucially, because the system can support reasoning about properties of numbers, the results are equivalent to reasoning about provability of their equivalent statements.</template>

<pattern>THE MAIN PROBLEM IN FLESHING OUT THE PROOF DESCRIBED ABOVE IS THAT IT SEEMS AT FIRST THAT TO CONSTRUCT A STATEMENT P THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO P CANNOT BE PROVED P WOULD SOMEHOW HAVE TO CONTAIN A REFERENCE TO P WHICH COULD EASILY GIVE RISE TO AN INFINITE REGRESS . GÖDEL S INGENIOUS TECHNIQUE IS TO SHOW THAT STATEMENTS CAN BE MATCHED WITH NUMBERS ( OFTEN CALLED THE ARITHMETIZATION OF SYNTAX ) IN SUCH A WAY THAT PROVING A STATEMENT CAN BE REPLACED WITH TESTING WHETHER A NUMBER HAS A GIVEN PROPERTY . THIS ALLOWS A SELF-REFERENTIAL FORMULA TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS ANY INFINITE REGRESS OF DEFINITIONS . THE SAME TECHNIQUE WAS LATER USED BY ALAN TURING IN HIS WORK ON THE ENTSCHEIDUNGSPROBLEM</pattern>
<template>The main problem in fleshing out the proof described above is that it seems at first that to construct a statement p that is equivalent to "p cannot be proved", p would somehow have to contain a reference to p, which could easily give rise to an infinite regress. Gödel's ingenious technique is to show that statements can be matched with numbers (often called the arithmetization of syntax) in such a way that "proving a statement" can be replaced with "testing whether a number has a given property". This allows a self-referential formula to be constructed in a way that avoids any infinite regress of definitions. The same technique was later used by Alan Turing in his work on the Entscheidungsproblem.</template>

<template>There are two distinct senses of the word "undecidable" in mathematics and computer science. The first of these is the proof-theoretic sense used in relation to Gödel's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system.  The second sense, which will not be discussed here, is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set (see undecidable problem).</template>

<pattern>THE SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM DOES NOT RULE OUT ALTOGETHER THE POSSIBILITY OF PROVING THE CONSISTENCY OF SOME THEORY T ONLY DOING SO IN A THEORY THAT T ITSELF CAN PROVE TO BE CONSISTENT .

<template>The second incompleteness theorem does not rule out altogether the possibility of proving the consistency of some theory T, only doing so in a theory that T itself can prove to be consistent.

<pattern>THE COROLLARY ALSO INDICATES THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL RELEVANCE OF THE SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM . IT WOULD ACTUALLY PROVIDE NO INTERESTING INFORMATION IF A SYSTEM F PROVED ITS CONSISTENCY . THIS IS BECAUSE INCONSISTENT THEORIES PROVE EVERYTHING INCLUDING THEIR CONSISTENCY . THUS A CONSISTENCY PROOF OF F IN F WOULD GIVE US NO CLUE AS TO WHETHER F REALLY IS CONSISTENT ; NO DOUBTS ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF F WOULD BE RESOLVED BY SUCH A CONSISTENCY PROOF . THE INTEREST IN CONSISTENCY PROOFS LIES IN THE POSSIBILITY OF PROVING THE CONSISTENCY OF A SYSTEM F IN SOME SYSTEM F THAT IS IN SOME SENSE LESS DOUBTFUL THAN F ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE WEAKER THAN F . FOR MANY NATURALLY OCCURRING THEORIES F AND F SUCH AS F = ZERMELO – FRAENKEL SET THEORY AND F = PRIMITIVE RECURSIVE ARITHMETIC THE CONSISTENCY OF F IS PROVABLE IN F AND THUS F CANNOT PROVE THE CONSISTENCY OF F BY THE ABOVE COROLLARY OF THE SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM</pattern>
<template>The corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would actually provide no interesting information if a system F proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of F in F would give us no clue as to whether F really is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of F would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a system F in some system F' that is in some sense less doubtful than F itself, for example weaker than F. For many naturally occurring theories F and F', such as F = Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and F' = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of F' is provable in F, and thus F' cannot prove the consistency of F by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.</template>

<pattern>GÖDEL S SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM ALSO IMPLIES THAT A SYSTEM F1 SATISFYING THE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS OUTLINED ABOVE CANNOT PROVE THE CONSISTENCY OF ANY SYSTEM F2 THAT PROVES THE CONSISTENCY OF F1 . THIS IS BECAUSE SUCH A SYSTEM F1 CAN PROVE THAT IF F2 PROVES THE CONSISTENCY OF F1 THEN F1 IS IN FACT CONSISTENT . FOR THE CLAIM THAT F1 IS CONSISTENT HAS FORM FOR ALL NUMBERS N N HAS THE DECIDABLE PROPERTY OF NOT BEING A CODE FOR A PROOF OF CONTRADICTION IN F1 . IF F1 WERE IN FACT INCONSISTENT THEN F2 WOULD PROVE FOR SOME N THAT N IS THE CODE OF A CONTRADICTION IN F1 . BUT IF F2 ALSO PROVED THAT F1 IS CONSISTENT ( THAT IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH N ) THEN IT WOULD ITSELF BE INCONSISTENT . THIS REASONING CAN BE FORMALIZED IN F1 TO SHOW THAT IF F2 IS CONSISTENT THEN F1 IS CONSISTENT . SINCE BY SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM F1 DOES NOT PROVE ITS CONSISTENCY IT CANNOT PROVE THE CONSISTENCY OF F2 EITHER</pattern>
<template>Gödel's second incompleteness theorem also implies that a system F1 satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any system F2 that proves the consistency of F1. This is because such a system F1 can prove that if F2 proves the consistency of F1, then F1 is in fact consistent. For the claim that F1 is consistent has form "for all numbers n, n has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in F1". If F1 were in fact inconsistent, then F2 would prove for some n that n is the code of a contradiction in F1. But if F2 also proved that F1 is consistent (that is, that there is no such n), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in F1 to show that if F2 is consistent, then F1 is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, F1 does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of F2 either.</template>

Gödel commented on this fact in the introduction to his paper, but restricted the proof to one system for concreteness.  In modern statements of the theorem, it is common to state the effectiveness and expressiveness conditions as hypotheses for the incompleteness theorem, so that it is not limited to any particular formal system.

<template>To prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel demonstrated that the notion of provability within a system could be expressed purely in terms of arithmetical functions that operate on Gödel numbers of sentences of the system. Therefore, the system, which can prove certain facts about numbers, can also indirectly prove facts about its own statements, provided that it is effectively generated. Questions about the provability of statements within the system are represented as questions about the arithmetical properties of numbers themselves, which would be decidable by the system if it were complete.</template>

<template>Each effectively generated system has its own Gödel sentence. It is possible to define a larger system F' that contains the whole of F plus GF as an additional axiom. This will not result in a complete system, because Gödel's theorem will also apply to F', and thus F' also cannot be complete. In this case, GF is indeed a theorem in F', because it is an axiom. Because GF states only that it is not provable in F, no contradiction is presented by its provability within F'. However, because the incompleteness theorem applies to F', there will be a new Gödel statement GF' for F', showing that F' is also incomplete. GF' will differ from GF in that GF' will refer to F', rather than F.</template>

IN ADDITION NO EFFECTIVELY AXIOMATIZED CONSISTENT EXTENSION OF PEANO ARITHMETIC CAN BE COMPLETE</pattern>
<template>The theory of first order Peano arithmetic seems to be consistent. Assuming this is indeed the case, note that it has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can encode enough arithmetic for the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorem. Thus by the first incompleteness theorem, Peano Arithmetic is not complete. The theorem gives an explicit example of a statement of arithmetic that is neither provable nor disprovable in Peano's arithmetic. Moreover, this statement is true in the usual model. In addition, no effectively axiomatized, consistent extension of Peano arithmetic can be complete.</template>

<pattern>A FORMAL SYSTEM MIGHT BE SYNTACTICALLY INCOMPLETE BY DESIGN AS LOGICS GENERALLY ARE . OR IT MAY BE INCOMPLETE SIMPLY BECAUSE NOT ALL THE NECESSARY AXIOMS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED OR INCLUDED . FOR EXAMPLE EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY WITHOUT THE PARALLEL POSTULATE IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE SOME STATEMENTS IN THE LANGUAGE ( SUCH AS THE PARALLEL POSTULATE ITSELF ) CAN NOT BE PROVED FROM THE REMAINING AXIOMS . SIMILARLY THE THEORY OF DENSE LINEAR ORDERS IS NOT COMPLETE BUT BECOMES COMPLETE WITH AN EXTRA AXIOM STATING THAT THERE ARE NO ENDPOINTS IN THE ORDER . THE CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS IS A STATEMENT IN THE LANGUAGE OF ZFC THAT IS NOT PROVABLE WITHIN ZFC SO ZFC IS NOT COMPLETE . IN THIS CASE THERE IS NO OBVIOUS CANDIDATE FOR A NEW AXIOM THAT RESOLVES THE ISSUE</pattern>
<template>A formal system might be syntactically incomplete by design, as logics generally are. Or it may be incomplete simply because not all the necessary axioms have been discovered or included. For example, Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate is incomplete, because some statements in the language (such as the parallel postulate itself) can not be proved from the remaining axioms. Similarly, the theory of dense linear orders is not complete, but becomes complete with an extra axiom stating that there are no endpoints in the order. The continuum hypothesis is a statement in the language of ZFC that is not provable within ZFC, so ZFC is not complete. In this case, there is no obvious candidate for a new axiom that resolves the issue.</template>

PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF FIRST-ORDER LOGIC FORMAL SYSTEMS ARE ALSO CALLED FORMAL THEORIES . IN GENERAL A FORMAL SYSTEM IS A DEDUCTIVE APPARATUS THAT CONSISTS OF A PARTICULAR SET OF AXIOMS ALONG WITH RULES OF SYMBOLIC MANIPULATION ( OR RULES OF INFERENCE ) THAT ALLOW FOR THE DERIVATION OF NEW THEOREMS FROM THE AXIOMS . ONE EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SYSTEM IS FIRST-ORDER PEANO ARITHMETIC A SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL VARIABLES ARE INTENDED TO DENOTE NATURAL NUMBERS . IN OTHER SYSTEMS SUCH AS SET THEORY ONLY SOME SENTENCES OF THE FORMAL SYSTEM EXPRESS STATEMENTS ABOUT THE NATURAL NUMBERS . THE INCOMPLETENESS THEOREMS ARE ABOUT FORMAL PROVABILITY WITHIN THESE SYSTEMS RATHER THAN ABOUT PROVABILITY IN AN INFORMAL SENSE</pattern>
<template>The incompleteness theorems apply to formal systems that are of sufficient complexity to express the basic arithmetic of the natural numbers and which are consistent and effectively axiomatized. Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called formal theories. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms.  One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about "provability" in an informal sense.</template>

<template>The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers.  For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.</template>

The same stimulus may evoke any one of a large number of responses depending upon the contextual setting in which it is placed".[106] This research found that the time to complete a list was longer for mixed lists than for pure lists. For example, if a list was names of animals versus a list of the same size with names of animals, books, makes and models of cars, and types of fruits, it takes longer to process the second list.

<template>Wilhelm Wundt introduced the study of attention to the field of psychology. Wundt measured mental processing speed by likening it to differences in stargazing measurements. Astronomers in this time would measure the time it took for stars to travel.  Among these measurements when astronomers recorded the times, there were personal differences in calculation. These different readings resulted in different reports from each astronomer. To correct for this, a personal equation was developed. Wundt applied this to mental processing speed. Wundt realized that the time it takes to see the stimulus of the star and write down the time was being called an "observation error" but actually was the time it takes to switch voluntarily one's attention from one stimulus to another. Wundt called his school of psychology voluntarism. It was his belief that psychological processes can only be understood in terms of goals and consequences.</template>

"Malebranche held that we have access to ideas, or mental representations  of the external world, but not direct access to the world itself."[7] Thus in order to keep these ideas organized, attention is necessary. Otherwise we will confuse these ideas. Malebranche writes in "The Search After Truth", "because it often happens that the understanding has only confused and imperfect perceptions of things, it is truly a cause of our errors.... It is therefore necessary to look for means to keep our perceptions from being confused and imperfect.  And, because, as everyone knows, there is nothing that makes them clearer and more distinct than attentiveness, we must try to find the means to become more attentive than we are".[102] According to Malebranche, attention is crucial to understanding and keeping thoughts organized.</template>

<template>There has been little difference found between speaking on a hands-free cell phone or a hand-held cell phone,[5][28] which suggests that it is the strain of attentional system that causes problems, rather than what the driver is doing with his or her hands.  While speaking with a passenger is as cognitively demanding as speaking with a friend over the phone,[29] passengers are able to change the conversation based upon the needs of the driver.  For example, if traffic intensifies, a passenger may stop talking to allow the driver to navigate the increasingly difficult roadway; a conversation partner over a phone would not be aware of the change in environment.</template>

<template>The first of these models to appear in the literature is the spotlight model. The term "spotlight" was inspired by the work of William James, who described attention as having a focus, a margin, and a fringe.[11] The focus is an area that extracts information from the visual scene with a high-resolution, the geometric center of which being where visual attention is directed. Surrounding the focus is the fringe of attention, which extracts information in a much more crude fashion (i.e., low-resolution). This fringe extends out to a specified area, and the cut-off is called the margin.</template>

<pattern>IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO MODELS WHICH DESCRIBE HOW VISUAL ATTENTION OPERATES . THESE MODELS MAY BE CONSIDERED METAPHORS WHICH ARE USED TO DESCRIBE INTERNAL PROCESSES AND TO GENERATE HYPOTHESES THAT ARE FALSIFIABLE . GENERALLY SPEAKING VISUAL ATTENTION IS THOUGHT TO OPERATE AS A TWO-STAGE PROCESS . [ 10 ] IN THE FIRST STAGE ATTENTION IS DISTRIBUTED UNIFORMLY OVER THE EXTERNAL VISUAL SCENE AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION IS PERFORMED IN PARALLEL . IN THE SECOND STAGE ATTENTION IS CONCENTRATED TO A SPECIFIC AREA OF THE VISUAL SCENE ( I.E . IT IS FOCUSED ) AND PROCESSING IS PERFORMED IN A SERIAL FASHION</pattern>
<template>In cognitive psychology there are at least two models which describe how visual attention operates. These models may be considered metaphors which are used to describe internal processes and to generate hypotheses that are falsifiable. Generally speaking, visual attention is thought to operate as a two-stage process.[10] In the first stage, attention is distributed uniformly over the external visual scene and processing of information is performed in parallel. In the second stage, attention is concentrated to a specific area of the visual scene (i.e., it is focused), and processing is performed in a serial fashion.</template>

<template>Programming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as preferredWidth in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per-block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width if set.

The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.

[ 17 ] FOR AN EXTENDED FORMAT WITH A PRECISION BETWEEN TWO BASIC FORMATS THE EXPONENT RANGE MUST BE AS GREAT AS THAT OF THE NEXT WIDER BASIC FORMAT . SO FOR INSTANCE A 64 - BIT EXTENDED PRECISION BINARY NUMBER MUST HAVE AN EMAX OF AT LEAST 16383 . THE X87 80 - BIT EXTENDED FORMAT MEETS THIS REQUIREMENT</pattern>
<template>The standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying p and emax for each supported base b.[16] The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix b.[17] For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The x87 80-bit extended format meets this requirement.</template>

<template>The standard specifies optional extended and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.[15] An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (b, p, and emax). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.</template>

<template>The standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits).

HOWEVER FOR MOST OPERATIONS SUCH AS ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS THE RESULT ( VALUE ) DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE REPRESENTATION OF THE INPUTS</pattern>
<template>Some numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if b = 10, and p = 7, then −12.345 can be represented by −12345×10−3, −123450×10−4, and −1234500×10−5. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.</template>

<pattern>FOR EXAMPLE IF B = 10 P = 7 AND EMAX = 96 THEN EMIN = − 95 THE SIGNIFICAND SATISFIES 0 ≤ C ≤ 9999999 AND THE EXPONENT SATISFIES − 101 ≤ Q ≤ 90 . CONSEQUENTLY THE SMALLEST NON-ZERO POSITIVE NUMBER THAT CAN BE REPRESENTED IS 1 × 10 − 101 AND THE LARGEST IS 9999999 × 1090 ( 9.999999 × 1096 ) SO THE FULL RANGE OF NUMBERS IS − 9.999999 × 1096 THROUGH 9.999999 × 1096 . THE NUMBERS − B1 − EMAX AND B1 − EMAX ( HERE − 1 × 10 − 95 AND 1 × 10 − 95 ) ARE THE SMALLEST ( IN MAGNITUDE ) NORMAL NUMBERS ; NON-ZERO NUMBERS BETWEEN THESE SMALLEST NUMBERS ARE CALLED SUBNORMAL NUMBERS</pattern>
<template>For example, if b = 10, p = 7, and emax = 96, then emin = −95, the significand satisfies 0 ≤ c ≤ 9999999, and the exponent satisfies −101 ≤ q ≤ 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1×10−101, and the largest is 9999999×1090 (9.999999×1096), so the full range of numbers is −9.999999×1096 through 9.999999×1096. The numbers −b1−emax and b1−emax (here, −1×10−95 and 1×10−95) are the smallest (in magnitude) normal numbers; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called subnormal numbers.</template>

<template>Functional "platforms" have been popular in finance for risk analytics (particularly with the larger investment banks). Risk factors are coded as functions that form interdependent graphs (categories) to measure correlations in market shifts not unlike Gröbner basis optimizations but also for regulatory compliance such as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. Given the use of OCAML or CAML variations in finance, these systems are sometimes considered related to a categorical abstract machine or CAM. Indeed, functional programming is heavily influenced by category theory.</template>

THE USE OF ALGEBRAIC DATATYPES MAKES MANIPULATION OF COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURES CONVENIENT ; THE PRESENCE OF STRONG COMPILE-TIME TYPE CHECKING MAKES PROGRAMS MORE RELIABLE IN ABSENCE OF OTHER RELIABILITY TECHNIQUES LIKE TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT WHILE TYPE INFERENCE FREES THE PROGRAMMER FROM THE NEED TO MANUALLY DECLARE TYPES TO THE COMPILER IN MOST CASES</pattern>
<template>Especially since the development of Hindley–Milner type inference in the 1970s, functional programming languages have tended to use typed lambda calculus, rejecting all invalid programs at compilation time and risking false positive errors, as opposed to the untyped lambda calculus, that accepts all valid programs at compilation time and risks false negative errors, used in Lisp and its variants (such as Scheme), as they reject all invalid programs at runtime when the information is enough to not reject valid programs. The use of algebraic datatypes makes manipulation of complex data structures convenient; the presence of strong compile-time type checking makes programs more reliable in absence of other reliability techniques like test-driven development, while type inference frees the programmer from the need to manually declare types to the compiler in most cases.</template>

<template>The Scheme language standard requires implementations to support proper tail recursion, meaning they must allow an unbounded number of active tail calls.[58][59] Proper tail recursion is not simply an optimization; it is a language feature that assures users that they can use recursion to express a loop and doing so would be safe-for-space.[60] Moreover, contrary to its name, it accounts for all tail calls, not just tail recursion. While proper tail recursion is usually implemented by turning code into imperative loops, implementations might implement it in other ways. For example, CHICKEN intentionally maintains a stack and lets the stack overflow. However, when this happens, its garbage collector will claim space back,[61] allowing an unbounded number of active tail calls even though it does not turn tail recursion into a loop.</template>

<pattern>ITERATION ( LOOPING ) IN FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED VIA RECURSION . RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS INVOKE THEMSELVES LETTING AN OPERATION BE REPEATED UNTIL IT REACHES THE BASE CASE .

THIS COULD MAKE RECURSION PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TO USE INSTEAD OF IMPERATIVE LOOPS . HOWEVER A SPECIAL FORM OF RECURSION KNOWN AS TAIL RECURSION CAN BE RECOGNIZED AND OPTIMIZED BY A COMPILER INTO THE SAME CODE USED TO IMPLEMENT ITERATION IN IMPERATIVE LANGUAGES . TAIL RECURSION OPTIMIZATION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BY TRANSFORMING THE PROGRAM INTO CONTINUATION PASSING STYLE DURING COMPILING AMONG OTHER APPROACHES</pattern>
<template>Iteration (looping) in functional languages is usually accomplished via recursion. Recursive functions invoke themselves, letting an operation be repeated until it reaches the base case. In general, recursion requires maintaining a stack, which consumes space in a linear amount to the depth of recursion. This could make recursion prohibitively expensive to use instead of imperative loops. However, a special form of recursion known as tail recursion can be recognized and optimized by a compiler into the same code used to implement iteration in imperative languages. Tail recursion optimization can be implemented by transforming the program into continuation passing style during compiling, among other approaches.</template>

<template>Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes. It allows for a specific type of polymorphism (subtyping). The implementation in the subclass overrides (replaces) the implementation in the superclass by providing a method that has same name, same parameters or signature, and same return type as the method in the parent class.[1] The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed.[2] Some languages allow a programmer to prevent a method from being overridden.</template>

<pattern>METHOD OVERRIDING AND OVERLOADING ARE TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAYS THAT A METHOD DIFFERS FROM A CONVENTIONAL PROCEDURE OR FUNCTION CALL . OVERRIDING REFERS TO A SUBCLASS REDEFINING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A METHOD OF ITS SUPERCLASS . FOR EXAMPLE FINDAREA MAY BE A METHOD DEFINED ON A SHAPE CLASS [ 2 ] TRIANGLE ETC . WOULD EACH DEFINE THE APPROPRIATE FORMULA TO CALCULATE THEIR AREA . THE IDEA IS TO LOOK AT OBJECTS AS BLACK BOXES SO THAT CHANGES TO THE INTERNALS OF THE OBJECT CAN BE MADE WITH MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE OTHER OBJECTS THAT USE IT . THIS IS KNOWN AS ENCAPSULATION AND IS MEANT TO MAKE CODE EASIER TO MAINTAIN AND RE-USE</pattern>
<template>Method overriding and overloading are two of the most significant ways that a method differs from a conventional procedure or function call. Overriding refers to a subclass redefining the implementation of a method of its superclass. For example, findArea may be a method defined on a shape class,[2] triangle, etc. would each define the appropriate formula to calculate their area. The idea is to look at objects as "black boxes" so that changes to the internals of the object can be made with minimal impact on the other objects that use it. This is known as encapsulation and is meant to make code easier to maintain and re-use.</template>

<pattern>IN CLASS-BASED PROGRAMMING METHODS ARE DEFINED WITHIN A CLASS AND OBJECTS ARE INSTANCES OF A GIVEN CLASS . ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CAPABILITIES THAT A METHOD PROVIDES IS METHOD OVERRIDING - THE SAME NAME ( E.G . AREA ) CAN BE USED FOR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLASSES . THIS ALLOWS THE SENDING OBJECTS TO INVOKE BEHAVIORS AND TO DELEGATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE BEHAVIORS TO THE RECEIVING OBJECT . A METHOD IN JAVA PROGRAMMING SETS THE BEHAVIOR OF A CLASS OBJECT . FOR EXAMPLE AN OBJECT CAN SEND AN AREA MESSAGE TO ANOTHER OBJECT AND THE APPROPRIATE FORMULA IS INVOKED WHETHER THE RECEIVING OBJECT IS A RECTANGLE CIRCLE TRIANGLE ETC</pattern>
<template>In class-based programming, methods are defined within a class, and objects are instances of a given class. One of the most important capabilities that a method provides is method overriding - the same name (e.g., area) can be used for multiple different kinds of classes. This allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object. A method in Java programming sets the behavior of a class object. For example, an object can send an area message to another object and the appropriate formula is invoked whether the receiving object is a rectangle, circle, triangle, etc.</template>

<template>Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.

For he declared everything to be a priori, naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom.

<pattern>ANONYMOUS RECURSION CAN ALSO BE USED FOR NAMED FUNCTIONS RATHER THAT CALLING THEM BY NAME SAY TO SPECIFY THAT ONE IS RECURSING ON THE CURRENT FUNCTION OR TO ALLOW ONE TO RENAME THE FUNCTION WITHOUT NEEDING TO CHANGE THE NAME WHERE IT CALLS ITSELF .

<template>Anonymous recursion can also be used for named functions, rather that calling them by name, say to specify that one is recursing on the current function, or to allow one to rename the function without needing to change the name where it calls itself. However, as a matter of programming style this is generally not done.</template>

<pattern>ANONYMOUS RECURSION PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF CALLING THE CURRENT FUNCTION WHICH RESULTS IN DIRECT RECURSION . ANONYMOUS INDIRECT RECURSION IS POSSIBLE SUCH AS BY CALLING THE CALLER ( THE PREVIOUS FUNCTION ) OR MORE RARELY BY GOING FURTHER UP THE CALL STACK AND THIS CAN BE CHAINED TO PRODUCE MUTUAL RECURSION . THE SELF-REFERENCE OF THE CURRENT FUNCTION IS A FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF THE THIS KEYWORD IN OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ALLOWING ONE TO REFER TO THE CURRENT CONTEXT</pattern>
<template>Anonymous recursion primarily consists of calling "the current function", which results in direct recursion. Anonymous indirect recursion is possible, such as by calling "the caller (the previous function)", or, more rarely, by going further up the call stack, and this can be chained to produce mutual recursion. The self-reference of "the current function" is a functional equivalent of the "this" keyword in object-oriented programming, allowing one to refer to the current context.</template>

<pattern>IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE ANONYMOUS RECURSION IS IMPORTANT AS IT SHOWS THAT ONE CAN IMPLEMENT RECURSION WITHOUT REQUIRING NAMED FUNCTIONS .

<template>In theoretical computer science, anonymous recursion is important, as it shows that one can implement recursion without requiring named functions.

<pattern>IN PROGRAMMING PRACTICE ANONYMOUS RECURSION IS NOTABLY USED IN JAVASCRIPT WHICH PROVIDES REFLECTION FACILITIES TO SUPPORT IT . IN GENERAL PROGRAMMING PRACTICE HOWEVER THIS IS CONSIDERED POOR STYLE AND RECURSION WITH NAMED FUNCTIONS IS SUGGESTED INSTEAD . ANONYMOUS RECURSION VIA EXPLICITLY PASSING FUNCTIONS AS ARGUMENTS IS POSSIBLE IN ANY LANGUAGE THAT SUPPORTS FUNCTIONS AS ARGUMENTS THOUGH THIS IS RARELY USED IN PRACTICE AS IT IS LONGER AND LESS CLEAR THAN EXPLICITLY RECURSING BY NAME</pattern>
<template>In programming practice, anonymous recursion is notably used in JavaScript, which provides reflection facilities to support it. In general programming practice, however, this is considered poor style, and recursion with named functions is suggested instead. Anonymous recursion via explicitly passing functions as arguments is possible in any language that supports functions as arguments, though this is rarely used in practice, as it is longer and less clear than explicitly recursing by name.</template>

<template>In computer science, anonymous recursion is recursion which does not explicitly call a function by name. This can be done either explicitly, by using a higher-order function – passing in a function as an argument and calling it – or implicitly, via reflection features which allow one to access certain functions depending on the current context, especially "the current function" or sometimes "the calling function of the current function".</template>

<pattern>GÖDEL SETS ARE SOMETIMES USED IN SET THEORY TO ENCODE FORMULAS AND ARE SIMILAR TO GÖDEL NUMBERS EXCEPT THAT ONE USES SETS RATHER THAN NUMBERS TO DO THE ENCODING . IN SIMPLE CASES WHEN ONE USES A HEREDITARILY FINITE SET TO ENCODE FORMULAS THIS IS ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE USE OF GÖDEL NUMBERS BUT SOMEWHAT EASIER TO DEFINE BECAUSE THE TREE STRUCTURE OF FORMULAS CAN BE MODELED BY THE TREE STRUCTURE OF SETS . GÖDEL SETS CAN ALSO BE USED TO ENCODE FORMULAS IN INFINITARY LANGUAGES</pattern>
<template>Gödel  sets are sometimes used in set theory to encode formulas, and are similar to Gödel  numbers, except that one uses sets rather than numbers to do the encoding. In simple cases when one uses a hereditarily finite set to encode formulas this is essentially equivalent to the use of Gödel numbers, but somewhat easier to define because the tree structure of formulas can be modeled by the tree structure of sets.  Gödel  sets can also be used to encode formulas in infinitary languages.</template>

<pattern>THUS IN A FORMAL THEORY SUCH AS PEANO ARITHMETIC IN WHICH ONE CAN MAKE STATEMENTS ABOUT NUMBERS AND THEIR ARITHMETICAL RELATIONSHIPS TO EACH OTHER ONE CAN USE A GÖDEL NUMBERING TO INDIRECTLY MAKE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE THEORY ITSELF .

<template>Thus, in a formal theory such as Peano arithmetic in which one can make statements about numbers and their arithmetical relationships to each other, one can use a Gödel numbering to indirectly make statements about the theory itself. This technique allowed Gödel to prove results about the consistency and completeness properties of formal systems.</template>

<template>In the specific Gödel numbering used by  Nagel and Newman, the Gödel number for the symbol "0" is 6 and the Gödel number for the symbol "=" is 5. Thus, in their system, the Gödel number of the formula "0 = 0" is 26 × 35 × 56 = 243,000,000.</template>

<template>According to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, any number (and, in particular, a number obtained in this way) can be uniquely factored into prime factors, so it is possible to recover the original sequence from its Gödel number (for any given number n of symbols to be encoded).</template>

<category>
<pattern>GÖDEL NOTED THAT EACH STATEMENT WITHIN A SYSTEM CAN BE REPRESENTED BY A NATURAL NUMBER ( ITS GÖDEL NUMBER ) .

THE NUMBERS INVOLVED MIGHT BE VERY LARGE INDEED BUT THIS IS NOT A BARRIER ; ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT SUCH NUMBERS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED</pattern>
<template>Gödel noted that each statement within a system can be represented by a natural number (its Gödel number). The significance of this was that properties of a statement – such as its truth or falsehood – would be equivalent to determining whether its Gödel number had certain properties. The numbers involved might be very large indeed, but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that such numbers can be constructed.</template>

<category>
<pattern>A GÖDEL NUMBERING CAN BE INTERPRETED AS AN ENCODING IN WHICH A NUMBER IS ASSIGNED TO EACH SYMBOL OF A MATHEMATICAL NOTATION AFTER WHICH A SEQUENCE OF NATURAL NUMBERS CAN THEN REPRESENT A SEQUENCE OF SYMBOLS .

<template>A Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding in which a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, after which a sequence of natural numbers can then represent a sequence of symbols. These sequences of natural numbers can again be represented by single natural numbers, facilitating their manipulation in formal theories of arithmetic.</template>

<template>Not all logical systems are truth-valuational in the sense that logical connectives may be interpreted as truth functions. For example, intuitionistic logic lacks a complete set of truth values because its semantics, the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, is specified in terms of provability conditions, and not directly in terms of the necessary truth of formulae.</template>

<template>Multi-valued logics (such as fuzzy logic and relevance logic) allow for more than two truth values, possibly containing some internal structure. For example, on the unit interval [0,1] such structure is a total order; this may be expressed as the existence of various degrees of truth.</template>

THE ORIGINAL OBJECT A ( ANALOGOUS TO THE DERIVED CLASS BEHAVIORS ) CAN DELEGATE SOME OF ITS METHODS TO ANOTHER OBJECT B ( ANALOGOUS TO THE BASE CLASS BEHAVIORS ) .

<template>An alternative to classes and inheritance is prototypes and delegation,[2] which is used in prototype-based programming, and is more dynamic. Instead of using one class to refine another, delegation allows one object to override the behavior of another. The original object a (analogous to the derived class behaviors) can delegate some of its methods to another object b (analogous to the base class behaviors). If a delegates its foo method to the bar method of b, then any invocation of foo on a will cause b's bar method to execute. However, bar executes in the context of the a object, for example, its self identifier refers to a rather than to b.</template>

<template>The notion of computational complexity for the lambda calculus is a bit tricky, because the cost of a β-reduction may vary depending on how it is implemented.[29] 
To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable V in the expression E, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of the locations of free variables in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of V in E is O(n) in the length n of E. Director strings were an early approach that traded this time cost for a quadratic space usage.[30] More generally this has led to the study of systems that use explicit substitution.</template>

<template>The precise rules for α-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when α-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an α-conversion of λx.λx.x could result in λy.λx.x, but it could not result in λy.λx.y. The latter has a different meaning from the original.

Typed lambda calculi are weaker than the untyped lambda calculus, which is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that typed lambda calculi can express less than the untyped calculus can, but on the other hand typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proven; in the simply typed lambda calculus it is, for example, a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate. One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.</template>

<pattern>THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT THE PROPER DEFINITION FOR THE RESULT OF A NUMERIC FUNCTION THAT RECEIVES A QUIET NAN AS INPUT . ONE VIEW IS THAT THE NAN SHOULD PROPAGATE TO THE OUTPUT OF THE FUNCTION IN ALL CASES TO PROPAGATE THE INDICATION OF AN ERROR . ANOTHER VIEW AND THE ONE TAKEN BY THE ISO   C99 AND IEEE   754 - 2008 STANDARDS IN GENERAL IS THAT IF THE FUNCTION HAS MULTIPLE ARGUMENTS AND THE OUTPUT IS UNIQUELY DETERMINED BY ALL THE NON-NAN INPUTS ( INCLUDING INFINITY ) THEN THAT VALUE SHOULD BE THE RESULT . THUS FOR EXAMPLE THE VALUE RETURNED BY HYPOT ( ± ∞ QNAN ) AND HYPOT ( QNAN ± ∞ ) IS + ∞</pattern>
<template>There are differences of opinion about the proper definition for the result of a numeric function that receives a quiet NaN as input. One view is that the NaN should propagate to the output of the function in all cases to propagate the indication of an error. Another view, and the one taken by the ISO C99 and IEEE 754-2008 standards in general, is that if the function has multiple arguments and the output is uniquely determined by all the non-NaN inputs (including infinity), then that value should be the result. Thus for example the value returned by hypot(±∞, qNaN) and hypot(qNaN, ±∞) is +∞.</template>

<template>NaNs are not necessarily generated in all the above cases. If an operation can produce an exception condition and traps are not masked then the operation will cause a trap instead.[8] If an operand is a quiet NaN, and there is also no signaling NaN operand, then there is no exception condition and the result is a quiet NaN. Explicit assignments will not cause an exception even for signaling NaNs.</template>

<pattern>THE COMPARISON PREDICATES ARE EITHER SIGNALING OR NON-SIGNALING ON QUIET NAN OPERANDS ; THE SIGNALING VERSIONS SIGNAL THE INVALID-OPERATION EXCEPTION FOR SUCH COMPARISONS ( I.E .

THE OTHER STANDARD COMPARISON PREDICATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABOVE MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS ARE ALL SIGNALING IF THEY RECEIVE A NAN OPERAND . THE STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES NON-SIGNALING VERSIONS OF THESE OTHER PREDICATES . THE PREDICATE ISNAN ( X ) DETERMINES WHETHER A VALUE IS A NAN AND NEVER SIGNALS AN EXCEPTION EVEN IF X IS A SIGNALING NAN</pattern>
<template>The comparison predicates are either signaling or non-signaling on quiet NaN operands; the signaling versions signal the invalid-operation exception for such comparisons (i.e., by default, this just sets the corresponding status flag in addition to the behavior of the non-signaling versions). The equality and inequality predicates are non-signaling. The other standard comparison predicates associated with the above mathematical symbols are all signaling if they receive a NaN operand. The standard also provides non-signaling versions of these other predicates. The predicate isNaN(x) determines whether a value is a NaN and never signals an exception, even if x is a signaling NaN.</template>

<pattern>THE PROPAGATION OF QUIET NANS THROUGH ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS ALLOWS ERRORS TO BE DETECTED AT THE END OF A SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS WITHOUT EXTENSIVE TESTING DURING INTERMEDIATE STAGES . FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE STARTS WITH A NAN AND ADDS 1 FIVE TIMES IN A ROW EACH ADDITION RESULTS IN A NAN BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO CHECK EACH CALCULATION BECAUSE ONE CAN JUST NOTE THAT THE FINAL RESULT IS NAN . HOWEVER DEPENDING ON THE LANGUAGE AND THE FUNCTION NANS CAN SILENTLY BE REMOVED FROM A CHAIN OF CALCULATIONS WHERE ONE CALCULATION IN THE CHAIN WOULD GIVE A CONSTANT RESULT FOR ALL OTHER FLOATING-POINT VALUES . FOR EXAMPLE THE CALCULATION X0 MAY PRODUCE THE RESULT 1 EVEN WHERE X IS NAN SO CHECKING ONLY THE FINAL RESULT WOULD OBSCURE THE FACT THAT A CALCULATION BEFORE THE X0 RESULTED IN A NAN . IN GENERAL THEN A LATER TEST FOR A SET INVALID FLAG IS NEEDED TO DETECT ALL CASES WHERE NANS ARE INTRODUCED [ 3 ] ( SEE FUNCTION DEFINITION BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS )</pattern>
<template>The propagation of quiet NaNs through arithmetic operations allows errors to be detected at the end of a sequence of operations without extensive testing during intermediate stages. For example, if one starts with a NaN and adds 1 five times in a row, each addition results in a NaN, but there is no need to check each calculation because one can just note that the final result is NaN.  However, depending on the language and the function, NaNs can silently be removed from a chain of calculations where one calculation in the chain would give a constant result for all other floating-point values.  For example, the calculation x0 may produce the result 1, even where x is NaN, so checking only the final result would obscure the fact that a calculation before the x0 resulted in a NaN.  In general, then, a later test for a set invalid flag is needed to detect all cases where NaNs are introduced[3] (see Function definition below for further details).</template>

<template>Floating-point operations other than ordered comparisons normally propagate a quiet NaN (qNaN).

<template>In 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (ClassCastExceptions) from occurring, it would be type safe.</template>

The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier and any number of public inner classes. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make one class (introduced by the class keyword) public (preceded by the public keyword) and name the source file with that public class name.</template>

<pattern>ONE OF THE IDEAS BEHIND JAVA S AUTOMATIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT MODEL IS THAT PROGRAMMERS CAN BE SPARED THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO PERFORM MANUAL MEMORY MANAGEMENT . IN SOME LANGUAGES MEMORY FOR THE CREATION OF OBJECTS IS IMPLICITLY ALLOCATED ON THE STACK OR EXPLICITLY ALLOCATED AND DEALLOCATED FROM THE HEAP . IN THE LATTER CASE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING MEMORY RESIDES WITH THE PROGRAMMER . IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT DEALLOCATE AN OBJECT A MEMORY LEAK OCCURS . IF THE PROGRAM ATTEMPTS TO ACCESS OR DEALLOCATE MEMORY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEALLOCATED THE RESULT IS UNDEFINED AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO BECOME UNSTABLE OR CRASH . THIS CAN BE PARTIALLY REMEDIED BY THE USE OF SMART POINTERS BUT THESE ADD OVERHEAD AND COMPLEXITY . NOTE THAT GARBAGE COLLECTION DOES NOT PREVENT LOGICAL MEMORY LEAKS I.E . THOSE WHERE THE MEMORY IS STILL REFERENCED BUT NEVER USED</pattern>
<template>One of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent logical memory leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.</template>

<template>In theory, every Self object is a stand-alone entity. Self has neither classes nor meta-classes. Changes to a particular object do not affect any other, but in some cases it is desirable if they did. Normally an object can understand only messages corresponding to its local slots, but by having one or more slots indicating parent objects, an object can delegate any message it does not understand itself to the parent object. Any slot can be made a parent pointer by adding an asterisk as a suffix. In this way Self handles duties that would use inheritance in class-based languages. Delegation can also be used to implement features such as namespaces and lexical scoping.</template>

BASIC OBJECTS THAT ARE USED PRIMARILY TO MAKE COPIES ARE KNOWN AS PROTOTYPES . THIS TECHNIQUE IS CLAIMED TO GREATLY SIMPLIFY DYNAMISM .

<template>Instead of having an "instance" of an object that is based on some "class", in Self one makes a copy of an existing object, and changes it. So Bob's car would be created by making a copy of an existing "Vehicle" object, and then adding the drive fast method, modelling the fact that it happens to be a Porsche 911. Basic objects that are used primarily to make copies are known as prototypes. This technique is claimed to greatly simplify dynamism. If an existing object (or set of objects) proves to be an inadequate model, a programmer may simply create a modified object with the correct behavior, and use that instead. Code which uses the existing objects is not changed.</template>

Their objective was to push forward the state of the art in object-oriented programming language research, once Smalltalk-80 was released by the labs and began to be taken seriously by the industry. They moved to Stanford University and continued work on the language, building the first working Self compiler in 1987. At that point, focus changed to attempting to bring up an entire system for Self, as opposed to just the language.</template>

<template>Some of the self messages sent by the template method may be to hook methods.  These methods are implemented in the same base class as the template method, but with empty bodies (i.e., they do nothing).  Hook methods exist so that subclasses can override them, and can thus fine-tune the action of the algorithm without the need to override the template method itself. In other words, they provide a "hook" on which to "hang" variant implementations.</template>

<pattern>AT RUN-TIME THE ALGORITHM REPRESENTED BY THE TEMPLATE METHOD IS EXECUTED BY SENDING THE TEMPLATE MESSAGE TO AN INSTANCE OF ONE OF THE CONCRETE SUBCLASSES . THROUGH INHERITANCE THE TEMPLATE METHOD IN THE BASE CLASS STARTS TO EXECUTE . WHEN THE TEMPLATE METHOD SENDS A MESSAGE TO SELF REQUESTING ONE OF THE HELPER METHODS THE MESSAGE WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE CONCRETE SUB-INSTANCE . IF THE HELPER METHOD HAS BEEN OVERRIDDEN THE OVERRIDING IMPLEMENTATION IN THE SUB-INSTANCE WILL EXECUTE ; IF IT HAS NOT BEEN OVERRIDDEN THE INHERITED IMPLEMENTATION IN THE BASE CLASS WILL EXECUTE . THIS MECHANISM ENSURES THAT THE OVERALL ALGORITHM FOLLOWS THE SAME STEPS EVERY TIME WHILE ALLOWING THE DETAILS OF SOME STEPS TO DEPEND ON WHICH INSTANCE RECEIVED THE ORIGINAL REQUEST TO EXECUTE THE ALGORITHM</pattern>
<template>At run-time, the algorithm represented by the template method is executed by sending the template message to an instance of one of the concrete subclasses.  Through inheritance, the template method in the base class starts to execute.  When the template method sends a message to self requesting one of the helper methods, the message will be received by the concrete sub-instance. If the helper method has been overridden, the overriding implementation in the sub-instance will execute; if it has not been overridden, the inherited implementation in the base class will execute.  This mechanism ensures that the overall algorithm follows the same steps every time, while allowing the details of some steps to depend on which instance received the original request to execute the algorithm.</template>

A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal.[151] Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.</template>

Since b ≥ φN−1, then N − 1 ≤ logφb. Since log10φ > 1/5, (N − 1)/5 < log10φ logφb = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.</template>

<pattern>A FINITE FIELD IS A SET OF NUMBERS WITH FOUR GENERALIZED OPERATIONS . THE OPERATIONS ARE CALLED ADDITION SUBTRACTION MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION AND HAVE THEIR USUAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS COMMUTATIVITY ASSOCIATIVITY AND DISTRIBUTIVITY . AN EXAMPLE OF A FINITE FIELD IS THE SET OF 13 NUMBERS { 0   1   2   . . .   12 } USING MODULAR ARITHMETIC . IN THIS FIELD THE RESULTS OF ANY MATHEMATICAL OPERATION ( ADDITION SUBTRACTION MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION ) IS REDUCED MODULO 13 ; THAT IS MULTIPLES OF 13 ARE ADDED OR SUBTRACTED UNTIL THE RESULT IS BROUGHT WITHIN THE RANGE 0 – 12 . FOR EXAMPLE THE RESULT OF 5   ×   7   =   35   MOD   13   =   9 . SUCH FINITE FIELDS CAN BE DEFINED FOR ANY PRIME P ; USING MORE SOPHISTICATED DEFINITIONS THEY CAN ALSO BE DEFINED FOR ANY POWER M OF A PRIME P   M . FINITE FIELDS ARE OFTEN CALLED GALOIS FIELDS AND ARE ABBREVIATED AS GF ( P ) OR GF ( P   M )</pattern>
<template>A finite field is a set of numbers with four generalized operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0, 1, 2, ..., 12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5 × 7 = 35 mod 13 = 9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p m. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p m).</template>

<template>The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in common use.[25] It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the algorithm is formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.</template>

<template>The validity of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument.[14] In the first step, the final nonzero remainder rN−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since it is a common divisor, it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor g.

<pattern>ANOTHER DEFINITION OF THE GCD IS HELPFUL IN ADVANCED MATHEMATICS PARTICULARLY RING THEORY . [ 10 ] THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR G   OF TWO NONZERO NUMBERS A AND B IS ALSO THEIR SMALLEST POSITIVE INTEGRAL LINEAR COMBINATION THAT IS THE SMALLEST POSITIVE NUMBER OF THE FORM UA   +   VB WHERE U AND V ARE INTEGERS . THE SET OF ALL INTEGRAL LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF A AND B IS ACTUALLY THE SAME AS THE SET OF ALL MULTIPLES OF G ( MG WHERE M IS AN INTEGER ) .

SOME PROPERTIES OF THE GCD ARE IN FACT EASIER TO SEE WITH THIS DESCRIPTION FOR INSTANCE THE FACT THAT ANY COMMON DIVISOR OF A AND B ALSO DIVIDES THE GCD ( IT DIVIDES BOTH TERMS OF UA   +   VB ) . THE EQUIVALENCE OF THIS GCD DEFINITION WITH THE OTHER DEFINITIONS IS DESCRIBED BELOW</pattern>
<template>Another definition of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory.[10] The greatest common divisor g  of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua + vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually the same as the set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated by g alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua + vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.</template>

THE SIDES OF THE RECTANGLE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SEGMENTS OF LENGTH C WHICH DIVIDES THE RECTANGLE INTO A GRID OF SQUARES OF SIDE LENGTH C . THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR G IS THE LARGEST VALUE OF C FOR WHICH THIS IS POSSIBLE . FOR ILLUSTRATION A 24 - BY-60 RECTANGULAR AREA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO A GRID OF : 1 - BY-1 SQUARES 2 - BY-2 SQUARES 3 - BY-3 SQUARES 4 - BY-4 SQUARES 6 - BY-6 SQUARES OR 12 - BY-12 SQUARES . THEREFORE 12 IS THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF 24 AND 60 . A 24 - BY-60 RECTANGULAR AREA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO A GRID OF 12 - BY-12 SQUARES WITH TWO SQUARES ALONG ONE EDGE ( 24 / 12   =   2 ) AND FIVE SQUARES ALONG THE OTHER ( 60 / 12   =   5 )</pattern>
<template>The GCD can be visualized as follows.[5] Consider a rectangular area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12 = 2) and five squares along the other (60/12 = 5).</template>

<template>The version of the Euclidean algorithm described above (and by Euclid) can take many subtraction steps to find the GCD when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other. A more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps, instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two (with this version, the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder). With this improvement, the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer.  This was proven by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, and marks the beginning of computational complexity theory.  Additional methods for improving the algorithm's efficiency were developed in the 20th century.</template>

<pattern>THE EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF TWO NUMBERS DOES NOT CHANGE IF THE LARGER NUMBER IS REPLACED BY ITS DIFFERENCE WITH THE SMALLER NUMBER . FOR EXAMPLE 21 IS THE GCD OF 252 AND 105 ( AS 252   =   21   ×   12 AND 105   =   21   ×   5 ) AND THE SAME NUMBER 21 IS ALSO THE GCD OF 105 AND 252   −   105   =   147 . SINCE THIS REPLACEMENT REDUCES THE LARGER OF THE TWO NUMBERS REPEATING THIS PROCESS GIVES SUCCESSIVELY SMALLER PAIRS OF NUMBERS UNTIL THE TWO NUMBERS BECOME EQUAL . WHEN THAT OCCURS THEY ARE THE GCD OF THE ORIGINAL TWO NUMBERS . BY REVERSING THE STEPS OR USING THE EXTENDED EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM THE GCD CAN BE EXPRESSED AS A LINEAR COMBINATION OF THE TWO ORIGINAL NUMBERS THAT IS THE SUM OF THE TWO NUMBERS EACH MULTIPLIED BY AN INTEGER ( FOR EXAMPLE 21 = 5 × 105 + ( − 2 ) × 252 ) . THE FACT THAT THE GCD CAN ALWAYS BE EXPRESSED IN THIS WAY IS KNOWN AS BÉZOUT S IDENTITY</pattern>
<template>The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.  For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (as 252 = 21 × 12 and 105 = 21 × 5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 252 − 105 = 147. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal.  When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.  By reversing the steps or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, the GCD can be expressed as a linear combination of the two original numbers, that is the sum of the two numbers, each multiplied by an integer (for example, 21 = 5 × 105 + (−2) × 252). The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as Bézout's identity.</template>

IT IS NAMED AFTER THE ANCIENT GREEK MATHEMATICIAN EUCLID WHO FIRST DESCRIBED IT IN HIS ELEMENTS ( C . 300 BC ) . IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ALGORITHM A STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE FOR PERFORMING A CALCULATION ACCORDING TO WELL-DEFINED RULES AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST ALGORITHMS IN COMMON USE .

<template>In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm,[note 1] or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers), the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it in his Elements (c. 300 BC).
It is an example of an algorithm, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,
and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.</template>

<pattern>PURPOSE OF CRITICISM [ EDIT ]</pattern>
<template>Rhetorical criticism serves several purposes or functions. First, rhetorical criticism hopes to help form or improve public taste. It helps educate audiences and develops them into better judges of rhetorical situations by reinforcing ideas of value, morality, and suitability. Rhetorical criticism can thus contribute to the audience's understanding of themselves and society.</template>

<pattern>KNOWLEDGE [ EDIT ]</pattern>
<template>The relationship between rhetoric and knowledge is an old and interesting philosophical problem, partly because of our different assumptions on the nature of knowledge. But it is fairly clear that while knowledge is primarily concerned with what is commonly known as "truth", rhetoric is primarily concerned with statements and their effects on the audience. The word "rhetoric" may also refer to "empty speak", which reflects an indifference to truth, and in this sense rhetoric is adversarial to knowledge. Plato famously criticized the Sophists for their rhetoric which had persuaded people to sentence his friend Socrates to death regardless of what was true. However, rhetoric is also used in the construction of true arguments, or in identifying what is relevant, the crux of the matter, in a selection of true but otherwise trivial statements. Hence, rhetoric is also closely related to knowledge.</template>
