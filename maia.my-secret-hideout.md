My secret hideout is a delicately mosaiced platform hanging in a poplar thicket. The walls are traced with radiating mandalas in smoky blue. The central chamber is spare but comfortable.

The view is amazing. I can see the trees rising from the water below. Occasionally something moves beneath the surface of the swamp.

Near there is a closet. Dust lies thinly everywhere; I've got mineral specimens. Many of these things are irreplaceable.

Behind that is a room stacked with books. Moroccan histories are mixed with obscure manuals. The scent of ink permeates the place.

My power comes from the swamp. Low phosphorescent flowers float in the waterways, gathering methane; the vapor passes through vines to an organic fuel cell.

On the right side is a chamber set aside for my writing, a narrow space panelled in carved wood. An old-fashioned worktable sits in the center, and a plate of cheese sits on a side table.
