My secret hideout is a fantastically-decorated hut perched in a tamarind. A row of logs, engraved with pictographs and astronomical ideographs, opens to a dim living chamber, overgrown with ivy.

To the left is the place where I write, a narrow area decorated here and there with tiny relief carvings. A clean worktable is waiting.

Above that is where I keep my books. Occult technical references are piled everywhere. The smell of paper fills the room.

Behind that is a room where I keep leftover rolls of wrapping paper.

To one side is where I keep my storehouse of fossils. Long days of searching the canyons have turned up many bony fish teeth and giant sloth's claws.

Getting into the treehouse is no problem. A crude ladder runs down the tree.
