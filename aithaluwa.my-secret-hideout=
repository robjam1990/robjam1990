My secret hideout is a row of intricately-fitted cubbies perched in a cluster of sagging apples. Beyond a broad doorway is a bright, spacious core room, restful and quiet.

To the right is a storage space with some dirty brushes, some packing foam, and I don't even know what else scattered everywhere. Nothing here is good for much, probably.

A miniature observatory is below that. It's a small enclosed dome, gimballed to rotate freely; a tiny but powerful telescope is built in. The doorway is blocked by a dark curtain. The arrangement was a challenge to construct, but worthwhile.

To one side, through a crooked doorway, is my library. Lurid romances are piled everywhere. Wicker chairs are scattered around.

Living in a tree is cool. A shaky ladder leads down the tree. I've planted thorn bushes around the base of the tree, to keep away bears. I've never seen a bear, but one never knows.

Near there is a stillroom. The agrimony is in and ready to store, but I need to make room for the feverfew. Small drawers in back hold samples of other herbs I've found; the floor needs a good sweeping.
