My secret hideout is a heavy wooden hut hanging from a sagging mangrove. A doorway of rough beams leads to a central room, filled with dry leaves.

My power comes from the swamp. Low phosphorescent flowers float in the waterways, gathering methane; the vapor passes up hollow vines to a fuel cell.

Getting into the treehouse is fun. A dumbwaiter is built into the trunk of the tree. It's cramped, but it travels up and down without too much trouble. I've planted thorn bushes around the base of the tree.

The view is incredible; I can watch the water moving slowly between the trees.

In the rear is a storeroom full of my collection of small colorful plastic puzzles.

An observatory is to the right. It's a neat platform, open to the stars, and furnished with a repurposed dentist's chair and an array of refractors. The arrangement was a challenge to construct, but worthwhile. The floor is chocked to lie level on its underlying beams.
