My secret hideout is a delicately-engraved ring of cubes spread through a mangrove copse. A hallway, carved with symmetrical astrological outlines, leads one to a sleeping chamber, filled with dry leaves.

A small observatory is to one side. It's a compact enclosed dome, gimballed to rotate freely; a miniature but strong telescope is built in. I have spent many nights there. The walls are hung with timetables and ephemerae.

Above that, through a low arch, is a library of books I've cached. Baroque Javanese novels and messy manuscripts are everywhere.

Below that is a closet. Dust lies thinly everywhere; I've got mineral specimens. Many of these things are irreplaceable.

An elevator is built into the trunk of the tree. It's cramped, but it lets me get up and down easily enough. However, you'll never find the place unless you know exactly where it is.

The view is amazing; I can see the shadows of fish moving in the stagnant water. Moss trails from the tree branches.

My secret hideout is a beautifully-engraved group of cubes spread through a maple stand. Astronomical symbols are visible here and there, drawn in yellow. The wide, crooked living chamber is thickly padded with moss.

An observatory is to the right. It's a compact platform, open to the stars, and furnished with an overstuffed armchair and an assembly of curved mirrors. The walls are decorated with star maps and posters of distant nebulae. A decorative ormolu clock stands on a pile of blocks.

To one side is the stillroom, where bundles of horehound and lemon balm are hanging to dry. A basket of new dandelion waits for tonight's dinner.

Living in a tree is awesome. A beautifully engineered spiral staircase leads around the tree from top to bottom. I've planted thorn bushes around the base of the tree, to keep away bears.

On the right side, beyond a secret arch, is where I keep my books. Occult reference books are neatly shelved there. A basket of bread sits on a side table.
