My secret hideout is a carefully measured wooden hut perched in a mangrove grove. A low opening opens to a tall central chamber which is thickly padded with moss.

Getting into the treehouse is fun. A delightful spiral staircase leads around the tree, all the way up. I can also lower a bucket.

The view is incredible. I can see the shadows of fish moving in the stagnant water.

The construction is powered by a neat cast-iron steam boiler, clanking cheerfully in a hollow in the trunk, in a small cabinet.

An observatory is on the right side. It's a miniature platform, open to the stars, and furnished with a repurposed dentist's chair and an array of refractors. The arrangement was a challenge to construct, but worthwhile. The floor is carefully levelled on the underlying beams.

Behind that is a room full of old game maps, assorted dolls, and I don't even know what else. A musty odor hangs in the air.

My secret hideout is a beautifully-engraved group of rooms hung around a locust. The walls are covered with narrow bands. The sleeping chamber is thickly padded with moss.

To the left is a storeroom. I'm pretty sure I know where everything is; the room is filled with empty boxes, plus old game maps. I'll never use any of it, I'm sure.

A periscope sticks up from the hideout. With that, I can see the treetops waving slowly below me.

In the rear is a stillroom. The yarrow is in and ready to store, but I need to make room for the cinquefoil. An arrangement of fresh flowers sprouts from a vase. The place needs tidying, though.

An observatory is below that. It's a neat sealed room, painted white. Starlight is focussed through a rooftop aperture and is projected onto the walls. A rack of astronomy textbooks (and some on plasma physics) stands to the side.

Above that is where I keep my books. German histories are piled everywhere.
