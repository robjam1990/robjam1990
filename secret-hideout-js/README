_My Secret Hideout_ was my first iOS app. I released it in 2011, while
working on _Hadean Lands_. I figured that HL might take a while (yep!)
and that I should have a steady stream of side projects to bring in
money and keep my name visible.

_My Secret Hideout_ was a quirky experiment â€” a procedural-generation
software toy. (2011 was before the Great Bot Era; procedural text
generation was still an obscure IF gimmick.) I wanted it to be fun to
read, and fun in a finger-twiddling sense as well. People enjoyed it,
but not, in the end, very many people. It sold something like 700
copies over five years.

In January of 2017, Apple sent me a notice that I should update the
app, please, or they would drop it from the App Store. Updating it
would have been a lot of work. The last time I touched the code, iOS 5
was brand-new and iPhones came in exactly one size! So I decided to
rewrite Hideout in Javascript and post it on Itch.IO.
