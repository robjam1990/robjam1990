My secret hideout is an ornately-mosaiced ring of cubbies spread through a stand of mangroves. A frieze of green dancing fish gives the structure a mysterious quality. The uneven living chamber is comfortably cluttered.

The green marsh waters lie all around. From the roof, I'll watch the fog drift slowly through the reeds below.

The treehouse is easily defensible. A rope ladder of rough knots runs down the trunk. I've planted thorn bushes around the base of the tree, to keep away bears. I've never seen a bear, but one never knows.

On the left side, through a dim doorway, is my library. Lurid romances are piled everywhere. Wicker chairs are scattered around.

My power comes from the marsh. Broad phosphorescent flowers float in the waterways, trapping methane; the vapor passes through hollow vines to a high-tech fuel cell.

Near there is the room where I write, a low area decorated here and there with tiny relief carvings. My worktable is in back, and a pitcher of water rests nearby.
