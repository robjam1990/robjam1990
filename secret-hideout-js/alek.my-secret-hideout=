My secret hideout is a rough wooden hut hung by a tall tamarind. An arch of roughly cut logs leads one to a central chamber, filled with the scent of greenery.

To the right is my storehouse of fossils. Long days of searching the karst have turned up many broken trilobytes and megafaunal vertebrae.
