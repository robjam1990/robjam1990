[**IPLANT**];Imagination Protocol Logic - Augmentative Neural Tree.
;IPLANT is a programming language that utilizes "AI"{Artificial Intelligence}, "NLP"{Natural Language Processing} to create NodeTemplate='T'{Texturized}.
;is a simple programming language that utilizes a node-based pipeline to execute code. 
;The pipeline is a directed graph where each node is a block of code that can be executed. 
;The nodes are connected by edges that represent the flow of data between them. 
;The language is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it ideal for beginners and experts alike.
