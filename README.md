 *ROBJAM1990 is a "Markdown-Syntax" Language based affiliate.*
 `ject` is Custom Tool for various purposes such as parsing.
 `iplant` is a Custom Node-Based Pipeline which utilizes Quantum Field Theory,
 `NLP` is an old language, with my own custom twist of course to make it more "Poetic"
 (`QA`||`QC`) is my "Quantum Sculptur", my own creation for a classic-to-quantum `Algorithm`.

### Importing the libraries

[**IPLANT**];Imagination Protocol Logic - Augmentative Neural Tree.
;IPLANT is a programming language that utilizes "AI"{Artificial Intelligence}, "NLP"{Natural Language Processing} to create NodeTemplate='T'{Texturized}.
;is a simple programming language that utilizes a node-based pipeline to execute code. 
;The pipeline is a directed graph where each node is a block of code that can be executed. 
;The nodes are connected by edges that represent the flow of data between them. 
;The language is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it ideal for beginners and experts alike.
