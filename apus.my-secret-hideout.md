My secret hideout is a basket woven of branches, perched in a broad elm. There are no right angles anywhere; tiny flowers are laced through the walls. The central chamber is comfortably padded with moss.

Behind that is a room stacked with books. Action-packed novels and faded, abstruse grimoires from fallen Mu are everywhere. The air is quiet; a small plate of cheese rests on a sideboard.

Below that is a stillroom filled with vervain that I've gathered in the woods. The place needs tidying, though.

A peat-burning stove stands at the base of the tree, in a small cabinet. It warms the rooms, pushing hot air through hidden ducts throughout the treehouse.

Nearby is a place set aside for my writing. It is rather tranquil, and it is hung with swatches of woven cloth. My worktable is in back. A few handy reference books sit in the corner, literature and classical history.

A beautifully engineered spiral staircase leads along the trunk, all the way up. I can also abseil out if necessary.

My secret hideout is a beautifully-engraved group of rooms hung around a maple. A passage, incised with the figures of dancing birds, leads one to a broad central room, comfortably padded with moss.

Above that is the stillroom. The snakeroot is in and ready to store, but I need to make room for the liverwort. Jars of valerian are lined up in back; the place needs tidying, though.

A compact observatory is to the left. It's a miniature enclosed dome, gimballed to rotate freely; a tiny but high-powered telescope is built in. The floor is carved with a map of the constellations. The arrangement was a challenge to construct, but worthwhile.

Below that is a room packed with tall carved bookshelves. Rows of opaque symbologies and preternatural romances lean against physics textbooks. The air is cozy and warm.

To one side is a closet full of wire and string. Light filters in through narrow windows. I might need some of it someday.

The entire place draws all its power from the earth. A geothermal tap is immersed in a trickling hot spring, far below the surface. In case of emergency, I have a power crystal from vanished Mu.
