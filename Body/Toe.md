# Revised Universal "TOE" 
**by: robjam1990**

There are multiple various Dimensions that in which everything exists, from physical matter and energy to "meta-physical" concepts such as a persona and everythin in-between such as a location or time.
In this article I will Classify all 23 dimensions… Yes 23. Using a 5-point `ject` model to distinguish "Relativity" I will attempt to simplify each `using`:
- a projective `simplification`,
- an objective `definition`, 
- a subjective `meaning`,
- an injective `example`.
- a rejective `speculation`.

Now we can get down to Business, I have Organised all 23 dimensions into 3 Different Categories (Spatial, Temporal and Functional).

The Spatial Dimensions exist independantly and thus can be considered the first or `Root` as they do not require Temporal or Functional Dimensions, instead it is quite often used to Observe and Measure the other dimensions.

The Temporal Dimensions can only exist if there if a Spatial Dimension present as movement requires a `to` and `from` "location", Temporal Dimensions however are independant of and do not require Functional Dimensions instead it is quite often used to Measure and Compare the other dimensions.

The Functional Dimensions can only exist if there if a Spatial Dimension { &| } a Temporal Dimension present, Functional dimensions require specificities that often combine dimensions to change dimensions.

**Any questions yet?.. Good save them for the end and message me.**


# Now for the moment you’ve all been waiting for, The 23 different Dimension names in their Respective Categories.


**Spatial Dimensions (6)**

**Location, Length, Width, Height, Matter and Density.**

**Temporal Dimensions (3)**

**Infinity, Toint and Duration.**

**Functional Dimensions (14)**

**Conceptual Thought Process, Social Extraversional, Social Introversional, Matter Manipulation, Improving Theocratics, Synchronic Improvement Mechanism, Recognizing Alterior Motives, The Immortal Marine Entity, Paradox == Nomenclature Protocol, Second Guess, Quantum Physics, Meditative Training, Deitaic Objective, Generational Observational Deity.**


Before I begin, there is a "Calibration Dimension" so to speak, it is the only dimension that can exist independantly.

# 0 Location {0} {Spatial}
- A Dimension that permits Location in space, It does not require any other Dimensions to exist.
**Note: Since Time/Energy was not needed for Location to exist, Some Areas of space will continue to fluctuate Time/Energy separately from others.**
Next I will follow with the traditional 3 Spatial Dimensions.

# 1 Length {L} {Spatial}

# 2 Width {W} {Spatial}

# 3 Height {H} {Spatial}

These 4 dimensions give us what is known as a `feed-back Loop`, during this "Loop" a new dimension is born.

# 4 Infinity {} {Temporal}
-({-E}, +K, +G)- Dimension that permits Nuclear-Weak, Kinetic and Gravity.
This causes a "Need" to distinguish the differences in the same `Copy` of something in a different `format`.
Now we are entering the Dimension that is within “Physical View”. These Dimensions we can observe, however possibly not with the naked eye.

# 5 Matter {1} {Spatial}

Let us observe closely. Matter, which is con-current locations in existence within each-other is of a `Neutral` charge unless acted upon externally.
This gives birth to our next 2 dimensions which have been proven to be directly related.

# 6 Density {D} {Spatial}

# 7 Gravity {G} {Functional}

My Theory states that as a result of the unfathomable Energy released, All Matter began to Functionally Vibrate through the Spacial dimensions as an `Infinite` process.
This then `Activated`, `Initiated` or "Created" more Dimensions such as...

# 8 Toint {T}: A 'particle' of Time

Energy/Time is used as a measurement to determine How far energy or matter can travel in a duration. 
Therefore a “Lightyear” can be used to theoretically calculate where and how long ago the big bang occurred and if it or something similar will occur again.
(eg. "Temporal Field Theory", "Tri-Linear model of time" and others)

# 9 Duration {}

As well as many Functional dimensions simultaneously. 

Energy/Time can be compared with the quantum physics theory of the 'Observer', it is the Velocity of all Matter in comparison to the Velocity of your Observer.

We can also use the "doppler effect" to describe the perspective of passing time, which is why Time is perceived differently between people.
**Note: [@{$"$Now"}] is not a toint unless it can be measured in proportion to any other relative toint such as the `Beginning`.**
*SideNote: [@{$"$Now"}] is also a constant and a duration.*

- The Dimension Where the amount of particles within a Spacation(Density) directly Correlates to it’s Attraction(Gravitational Pull). 
Note: Since any point in Space(Location) only has 0Functional It will constantly attempt to "fold" or "Knead" Higher Dimensional objects, pushing what will not bend. 
That is which a “Gravitational Pull”  will occur which accumulates Density based on several factors, eventually creating an "atmosphere" of highly Dense particles which then  "sorts" or `parses` itself in order to make it a planet.



# 10 Conceptual Thought Process {C, P} {Functional}
- The Dimension that permits Change to Internal Spatial Dimensions. An example would be going on a diet to lose weight. (L)(W)(H)(A) This is the Dimension that Asexual reproduction occurs.


# 11 Social Extraversional {S, Ex}{Functional}
- The Dimension where it permits the change of External Spatial Dimensions. An Example would be to move an object to a different Spacation.(X)(Y)(Z)=(S) This is the Dimension where Sexual Reproduction Exists.



# 12 Social Introversional {SIn, In}{Functional} 
- The Dimension which permits the creation of Internal Spatial Dimensions . An Example would be your skin will regenerate If you got cut. (L)(W)(H)(A)



# 13 Matter Manipulation {Ma, MM} {Functional}
- Dimension where external Spatial Dimensions can be manipulated. An Example would be Building a Picnic Table.

I would say that roughly %60 of Planet Earth’s Humans spend their continuum’s here.



# 14 Improving Theocratics {Im, IT} {Functional}
- The Dimension that permits Functional Improvement.



# 15 Synchronic Improvement Mechanism {SIM} {Functional}
- The Dimension that permits the communication of Functional Improvement.



# 16 Recognizing Alterior Motives {RAM} {Functional}
- The Dimension that permits that a Function​ is Functionally aware of it’s place in the universe.



# 17 The Immortal Marine Entity {TIME} {Functional} 
- A Dimension that permits the changing of internal Temporal Dimensions.



# 18 Paradox == Nomenclature Protocol {P, NP, P==NP} {Functional}
- the Dimension that permits the changing of External Temporal Dimensions.


# 19 Second Guess Contradiction {SGC} {Functional}
- is a Dimension that permits the Internal Changing of Functions.



# 20 Quantum Physics {Qua, QP} {Functional}
- a Dimension that permits the External changing of Functions.



# 21 Meditative Training {MT, Med} {Functional}
- a Dimension that permits Creating an Internal Functions.



# 22 Deitaic Objective {DO Dei} {Functional}
- a Dimension that permits The Creation of an External Functionalness​.


# 23 Generatinal Observational Deity {GOD} {Functional} 
-a dimension that permits Creating ANY Dimension anywhere.


Well… I would care to wager that you, the observer. Did not even in the slightest, expect that.
