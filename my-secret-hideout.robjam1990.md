My secret hideout is a rough-hewn row of chambers hung throughout a pine copse. A heavy hallway takes one to a sleeping chamber which is filled with the scent of growing things.

A neat observatory is below that. It's a miniature platform, open to the stars, and furnished with warm cushions and an assembly of lenses. A cheap electric clock stands on a pile of blocks.

A periscope sticks up from the structure. With that, I can see the peaks glittering in the afternoon sun. In the afternoons, the mountains cut triangular shadows through the blue air.

On the right side is the stillroom. The worktable is piled with alpine laurel and mountainheath that I've gathered. The light is dim.

Sunlight is collected by genetically engineered brown leaves and converted to electricity for me.

In the rear is a chamber set aside for writing, a round space lined with bundled hay. My worktable is in back.
