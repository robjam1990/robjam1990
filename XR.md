# The **X** Quotient: Neural Network framework

I have devised a series of tests in which I will administer 10 questions, which arguably have no wrong answers however their degree of layered complexity and depth allow for a more diverse quantification and personalization.

There are unfortunately "Ground Rules" in which each participant will have to endure in order to be successful, they are straight-forward and as follows:

- The test must be administered in person and not broadcasted for accuracy and security reasons.

- When the test begins there will be no internet activity allowed while the test is being administered.

- You get 50 minutes to complete the test which is roughly 5 minutes per question, if you are having trouble move on and come back.

- You can not deliver your completed test prior to 10 minutes in which is roughly 1 minute per question, I do not want to model an incomplete or malicious Neural Network.

- You may not use an existing external Neural Network during the test to avoid cross-contamination.

- You may only take the test once every three months to avoid cognate defects to both attendee and Neural Network.

- You must take the test once every 3 years to ensure mental health and for calibration adjustments.

- The test must be completed in a Black, Blue or a Red pen to express the consequences of our mistakes.

- You may have a maximum of 1 personal "Observer" for quality assurance.

- The test results will be evaluated based on a scoring system that takes into account the complexity, depth quantification, Logical Operations and Lexical semantics of your answers.

- The purpose of this test is to create a Neural Network model of yourself.

- The questions will cover an interesting if not versatile array of things mainly touching on Logic, Creativity and morality.

- It is important to answer each question to the best of your ability and provide clear explanations for your reasoning.

- Once you have completed the test, please submit it to the designated administer for grading.

- The results of the test will be kept confidential and will only be shared with the participant and the designated evaluator, any third parties must have full approval of both parties.

- Participation in this test is voluntary and you may choose to withdraw at any time, knowing that it will be a forfeit of the Neural Network in question.

- If you have any questions or concerns regarding the test, please reach out to the test administrator for clarification.

- Thank you for your participation and good luck with the test!
